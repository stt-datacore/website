Great Gams Torres' may not have made it past WRG's censors, but we regrettably have less filter here. Bump'lanna battled her way up the tiers shortly after release, scoring points with players via collections. That value abides along with solid shuttle metrics, but her voyage shelf life is all but tapped out, thanks to a poor skill set for that area.

With a Killing Game vanity a distinct possibility, Torres has an outside chance to see her trio of collections double over time to supplement thaw-able bases for a reasonable 1-2 super rare punch.
