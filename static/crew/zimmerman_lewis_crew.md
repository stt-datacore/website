For many players, especially in the early to mid game, an ENG primary crew with even mediocre bases can go a long way - and when that crew possesses SCI/MED, they suddenly become a fleck of gold in a pan of uninteresting iron. +1 Innovator is never going to hurt crew with such sterling voyage potential (#44, but numbers never tell the true story with a skill set this rare), but a lack of events and somewhat poor bases compared to his nearest competition, Sarina Douglas, just might. A handy ship ability that can boost Attack by 10 points helps his prospects, even if it does come married to a unfashionable Position trigger. +1 Iguana.
