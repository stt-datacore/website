Archer's daily use is limited, but his inclusion in the expansive Costumed collection has done a lot to rehabilitate his value. Paired with a spot in The Wild West, Archer's a must-have at some point in your gameplay, even if it's not until later. His trait lineup includes several names that have long been on the radar for untapped potential and supplement Archer's somewhat disappointing event history to make him shuttle-capable in spurts.
