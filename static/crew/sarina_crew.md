A great voyager for years has come down off the irreplaceable pedestal thanks to a fleshing out of ENG/MED crew and natural power creep. A couple of multi-collection pieces joined the game in 2020 as value replacements, though she will still hold her own in most cases. A strong SCI base is laudable, and although an equivalent Burnham or Dax might be better to keep around since they pick up a lot of events as well, Sarina's collection spot is a nice pivot if you're not big on Faction events.
