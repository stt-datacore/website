His event history is rock solid on paper - ever-present SEC seating for Riker events with a fistful of eventable traits. Considering his dreary voyage, gauntlet, and arena power, he's best thought of as a luxury choice for late game players with more gas in the tank for weekends and reasonable collection value.
