Another strong MED contender that will sit in your ranks for a while. #3 MED base which has some strong staying power. She’s in the same league as Ogawa but with a respectable SCI stat and the Physician collection too. You won’t be using her in Arena however, her +6 Accuracy bonus comes with a -2 Attack modifier which is a bizarrely contradictory combination.
