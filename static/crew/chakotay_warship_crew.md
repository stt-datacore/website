An almost purely trait-driven card at this point, Warship has the potential to climb the ranks despite his long time status as dud. Flaccid bases meet the right shuttle skills and a modest event clip to help him achieve spot-filler status, but streaky mega-driven years of relevance aren't out of reach either.

Owning a lone collection spot as of this write-up, that number is sure to grow over time. A heavily speculative option, don't feel obligated to feed him a crew slot if you're tight on space until his real world value has grown to reach his potential.
