There was a time when the T'Pucker love child's note read top five for Base and Voyage. Then top ten. Now it’s laughable.

As you'd expect, Voyages and Shuttles were his attributes du jour for the first few years in service, but the former is dead in the water and the latter is predictably unpredictable. He has a few non-bloated Traits that will allow him chances at weekend relevance, but no one can say when they'll come and ENG seating is rare in many Faction Events.

Collections might be his best offering now. Though more Crew offer multiple Collection spots with each passing month, his being paired with some borderline usability in other areas gives Lorian an argument to be a mid-level Behold choice, especially against poorer options. 

If you want a laugh, check out his Ship Ability, where an odd mix of Crit Rating and Evasion Activate after a Solar Beam-esque 18 seconds.
