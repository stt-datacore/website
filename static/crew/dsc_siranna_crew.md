A handsome MED base isn’t going to do you much good on a daily basis unless you’re Culber, but Siranna narrowly escapes the horrifying black hole where a lot of DIP/MED crew disappear to thanks to a healthy voyage rank. She may lapse into event obscurity unless we see that Gardener mega I’m hoping for, but on a day-to-day basis, she’s going to be fairly helpful, especially for those whose MED options are thin on the ground. Check back in a year - time might be kinder to her, depending on future Disco event prospects; the only 4* Disco MED is quite attractive in a lady, after all.
