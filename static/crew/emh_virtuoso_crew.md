Crew with any substantial amount of MED almost never have trouble finding a home on rosters. The best ingredient in his secret voyage sauce is paring SCI and MED which isn't terribly common among crew ranked higher. His events are frequent enough to elevate a variant-best DIP base and Inspiring is one of the tougher collection to complete even as the crew pool grows. Useful in spurts, if unspectacular.
