Ever wonder what she's carrying in her basket? The answer is all her freaking traits. Thirteen (!!!) to help trigger voyage and event bonuses when you least expect them. Troi’s event history is an embarrassment of riches and before you worry about the merit cost of all those thaws, consider that you’ll want to leave her in your active roster anyways for Fleet Boss Battles.

Mintakan Troi is the preeminent node cracker in FBB and while that anchors her value, there’s no doubt that her collection count will continue to rise over time. Post-release value bumps like this might be considered a stroke of luck for some crew, but it's exactly the kind of outcome you can expect when you target big trait lists like this.
