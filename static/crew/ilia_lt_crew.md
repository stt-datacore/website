In some alternate universe, finding value from this delightful Deltan would be the actual Kobayashi Maru. In the past, we've hawked the Romantic trait like we're on commission, but now worn by crew numbering well intro triple digits (and far bigger than any event bonus pool to date), we're giving that trait a Viking burial until and unless DB pulls a White Rabbit out of their hats.

Lacking any statistically unique or useful offering (yea, we've looked at the 2-skill voyage metrics) and with a painfully thin trait set, your pack pulling Persis-tence will be rewarded with a one-way ticket to cryostasis.
