A voyage exclusive crew from a two-parter, Thot Gor was an easy name to avoid for a long time with his single collection spot as a Diplomat. These days his reach in that area is much greater and should send you scurrying to the wiki to find out which dilemma options lead you to him.

There's little else of note here besides a slow-activating attack boost which will probably be obsolete by the time you fuse him, but his CMD base should at least merit the occasional thaw when his traits deign to break off a crumb of event bonuses on the weekend.
