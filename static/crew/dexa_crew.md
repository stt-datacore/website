"Come on Mylean" isn't the worst tagline for a crew in Dexa who will have your voyages running past midnight. Her debut profile was phenomenal there, although a lack of anti-matter traits (especially Civilian) starts to hurt as her relative power there falls over time.

That same underwhelming trait lineup relegates a 1500+ MED base to extremely spotty shuttle work and event bonuses should only be considered a pleasant surprise. The main sidecar to Dexa's voyage value is a #2 MED/ENG gauntlet pair which bridges the gulf between Caretaker and everybody else. She hits on twenty-one different 25% gauntlets wherein she's a viable early-to-midgame option for players.

The age of Fleet Boss Battles has given Dexa a third point of interest, hull repair for long engagements against the Doomsday Machine. While not a top tier option in that area, that attribute still adds to her retrieval profile if youâ€™re looking to solve several common new player issues with one crew.
