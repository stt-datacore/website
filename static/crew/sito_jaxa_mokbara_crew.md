The power creep of Super Rare crew continues apace! But then again, this was a crew that sort of had to be good, given the iconic nature of the scene and the climax of Sito's character arc. Debuting with a rare zero collections (yes, such things are still possible in this day and age), Worf's protege has a nice bevy of traits that could almost all hit both a collection, mega, or, as is increasingly the vogue, both. Heroes are made, not born, so make sure to look to the future when deciding if you want that final star. It's also not as if she isn't eminently useable elsewhere, sporting a SEC base that would make older, more reputable golds seem inadequate and a voyage score that will make her an all-star on rosters that have yet to make the jump to all legendary crew. All in all, a solid crew that will more than likely only improve with age - and the Cobra Kai bridge crew photos simply won't be complete without her.
