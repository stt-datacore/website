His #2 overall CMD proficiency roll, rivaled only by Kahless, gives him ranked pair power even against legendary crew and he frequently catches increased crit values, including three 45% sets and a 65% gauntlet. Perhaps even more attractive is his trio of stat-boosting collections sized ten to one hundred. Although his voyage work is outclassed by a single star of most gold crew and he may not make many thaw lists on account of poor bases, his elite offerings in the gauntlet and collections make him a mouth-watering target for players at any roster level.
