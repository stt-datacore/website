Well if Investigator Odo isn't your cup of tea then say hello to his far superior big brother. Constable shares the same Investigator trait and has the #2 SEC base stat as well. He is a bit tricky to equip, needing a fair few faction items but it's worth it to knock off some more difficult locked nodes and get a decent SEC crew. Sadly his ship ability is poor and his voyaging potential isn't the best but he's solid in other areas.
