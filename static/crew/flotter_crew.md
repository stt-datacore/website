Trevis and butthead are not the most esteemed names to join the game and their long-term value is uncertain, but there's still value here. Potential packed into tiny Trait sets comprise the bulk of the value for Trevis and...that other one. Hologram has had a field day with Events and all of their Traits are viable for further weekend bonuses or Collections.
