She’s not the classic T’Pau we need, but because of ongoing rights issues, she’s the T’Pau we deserve right now. The Raider of the Lost Kir’Shara makes up for any disappointment with a strong CMD base and CMD/SCI voyage total, and has a couple of event-catching traits up her sleeves that could help her find occasional weekend work. With position ships like the Shenzhou now available in Dabo, abilities like T’Pau’s +10 damage at 8 seconds become more usable and can make her a strong Arena/Skirmish piece in certain combos.
