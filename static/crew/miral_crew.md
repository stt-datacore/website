The Commadant rarely grants crew reprieve from the Pit of Despair, but the addition of one of the most valuable stat-boosters in the game has made Miral a virtually essential piece of the skill boost puzzle for late game players. Of course, by then such players will have no use for her during any possible trait (read:Klingon) events, leaving the collection to comprise all of her card's value.
