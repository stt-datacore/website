Imagine Ardra was actually a six foot android with heuristic learning systems and the strength of tin men. Ten, sorry. As a “variant”, this Data may be boring as sin, but he’s eminently usable.

Evergreen event work with a fistful of playable traits should see Data’s extremely reliable event history continue without interruption. And his strong ENG/SCI base metrics come in a package far preferable to the likes of JG Palmer for overall usage. With a voyage score atop his skill set (to help combat pathetic anti-matter traits), Data should see usage all over the field and should make for some very clever bridge crew photos.
