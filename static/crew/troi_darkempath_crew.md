Deanna de Vil, Deanna de Vil, if she can’t have Alkar, then nobody will. We never turn away CMD/MED or SEC/MED voyagers, and Troi is one of only two legendaries (Warship EMA) that contributes to both, and makes her unique enough to separate her from the pack of SEC/CMDs that surround her in the ranks. 

Troi's event count has been in a holding pattern lately, but that shouldn't continue for much longer, as ST:Picard will likely give her some new opportunities, and DB still probably has several prime variants under glass just in case revenue or event participation starts to slip. When Troi weekends return, Bride of Alkar-stein will bring the #1 CMD and #2 SEC base among Troi variants. Newer players may find use for her in the Gauntlet when she hits on a 45% crit trait match, but Troi is not likely to find her way on many lineups, and an over-handicapped Arena ability should keep her off your ships.

One thing though: if you decide to pass on her pack, don't let her find out about it. Just trust us, don’t do it.
