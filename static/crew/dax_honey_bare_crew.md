Some of us had posters of Kelly Kapowski or Rachel Green hanging in our bedrooms. Others had Jadzia Dax. If you're the latter, you're a few years late on this particular standee.

Once a heralded daily use crew with a formidable #DaxBrand for weekend work, time has been givin' her the business in the base and voyage department while she's oddly been one of the few crew to see a slow down in event work during the mega era.

She's still a usable event piece from time to time, but she's going to need some slacking traits to trigger alongside her vanity collection to bring her back up to a desirable level.
