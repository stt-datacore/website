Hemmer has spacewalked into our hearts and the game via his gorgeous EV-suited gold variant!  For all those forlorn Strange New Worlds fans who feel much maligned by his decrepit-at-introduction Honor Hall-exclusive cousin, EV Suit Hemmer helps to salve their damaged emotional centers with lovely art and improved voyage power.

Hemmer's skill order is populated by crew falling well outside of long-term voyage viability, including such "stalwarts" as Interfaced Barclay, The One, Lore, and Captain La Forge, so it's safe to say he has little competition there and Captains should be able to count on him remaining relevant for at least 2 more years.  He also catches four current antimatter seats, which is a nice set.

Hemmer is about tapped out on collections (but hopefully not variants) with a healthy four, and notably all four of them are toughies!  You want to avoid finishing Lissan, Jhamel, and Ushaan Shran?  Well, STOP (adding stars to them), HEMMER TIME!  (readers groan aloud)

Obigatory reference to his zero gauntlet viabiliy here...

One of Hemmer's hidden gems is... his ship ability!  If you can snag yourself a usable ship with a Position ability, you can get yourself a LIMITLESS 400% boom with a tight 14s cycle.  For reference, current FBB stalwart MACO Mayweather has a 16s, and Vindicta Mariner is equal to him at 14s.

All in all, we wish this Hemmer were in the Honor Hall instead.  Only those brave enough to wade into a Tuesday pack will earn him... or those patient enough to wait for the too-infrequent portal updates.
