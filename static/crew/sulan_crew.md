Phantom of the Opera Jr. has finally caught a trait mega, but it's not his bases that we're after. Gauntlet is the name of the game which is where B'Elanna's secret admirer owns four ranked pairs, including the #2 CMD/MED. His MED proficiency maximum is third in the game if you enjoy rolling the dice and a tertiary CMD is an asset for dodging competition there and on voyages too, where he has a chance to find a seat regardless of his bottom barrel voyage numbers.
