I know that you're probably asking yourself, why would a brilliant, handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny little bipedal specimen like Janeway? The answer: the Costumed collection!

Value for rosters of every level is available via her spot in the huge 100 threshold stat-booster, but this Janeway also pairs the only non-legendary MED available across all of her variants with an absurd 93% Faction hit rate. Bankable event value likely awaits this variant in the future, even if MED seats aren't always abundant.

Aside from those high points, middling voyage power should be viable for newer players for a while longer thanks to her MED primary and splash of MED/CMD. A name to target once she enters the portal.
