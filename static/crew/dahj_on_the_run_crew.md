We’ve got to quibble about a DIP primary for a character who gets into multiple extended fight sequences with murderous teleporting aliens that feature Dahj giving back suplexes, leaping fifty yards into the air, and breaking ankles. But in the spirit of power creeping DIP bases, at least it’s a big one!

Excelling for daily shuttles, at least until next week when the DIP factory prints another one, Dahj’s event chances are much murkier. If she’s not manning requisition shuttles without a bonus, there’s no telling how long between weekend junkets she may go. Picard show bonuses are a possibility, if not very likely. There’s also the fact that she and Soji won’t share any variant events, further limiting her utility. Worthwhile base metrics and DIP’s ubiquitous seating should give Dahj spots to contribute, but they won’t be regular.

Voyage work should be more consistent early on for Dahj. Her skill set is on the rare side and if they’re willing to print crew like Tawi'Yan Alexander as filler, she may last longer there than in other sets. Helping to contribute to a good all-round profile are a half dozen collection-viable traits, even if the large ones like Desperate and Civilian are wishful thinking. DOTR doesn’t pop in any one area, but has enough going in her favor to appeal to most types of players.
