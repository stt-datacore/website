Like most crew with three skills he is fairly middle of the road (still recovering from all that LDS he took in the 60s?). Some useful traits place him in 3 stat-boosting Collections (including the difficult to complete Musician one) and will help you out in two Cadet Missions. Good for early game voyages but donâ€™t expect him to crit many missions nodes outside of his trait bonus.
