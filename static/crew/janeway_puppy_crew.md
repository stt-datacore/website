Continuing the trend of uber-campaign crew being luxurious but ultimately inessential, Pupway springs onto the scene as a curious beast - unique enough among variants to stand out and snag voyage seats they couldn't even dream of staffing, but also just a little too weird to be of use where those variants usually shine, i.e. your annual quota of Janeway shuttles. The skill set is definitely nice, if a bit baffling, but while it impressed at Crufts' exclusive voyager category, it's the mangy mutt of Faction useage; Janeway simply doesn't have enough MED to ensure event seats that only this particular Kathryn can staff, and for someone with Janeway's pedigree, that's a problem.

Whereas her nearest competitor, Dexa, can rely on her superior power, Gauntlet capability, and reserved place in the pointing collection to win the hearts of players everywhere, Janeway has to rely on the oldest trick in the book - Q Continuum summoned Irish Setter pups in slightly airbrushed art, and let me tell you, the shine comes off real quick when the vet bills/campaign price point hit. A bland collections profile and almost complete lack of benefits outside of voyages make her easily skippable, but cheer up; if you do decide to grab her and Immortalise her, maybe her tier reward of a Premium pack in the Pet collection will give you a brief dopamine hit before you realise you could've been chasing other, more versatile crew instead.
