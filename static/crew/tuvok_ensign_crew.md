One of the cheapest crew in the game to level chroniton-wise, but requiring a handful of Vulcan faction items. Boasting the lowest SCI primary in the game means that Mister Tuvok is merely around to light the match on the expanded Vulcan collection, making him a mandatory cryo hero for a long time to come.
