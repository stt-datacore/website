You down with FTP? The tagline for this fusion fodder is “a new age Mobile Doctor". Resulting in a whopper of a crew, Spock's fusion with Anxious Kirk is significant value for this card and will generally be his best use going forward, assuming you can get your hands on his super rare counterpart. But how does he (fal-tor-)pan out on his other merits?

A Splash of MED isn't just a best seller at the Jamba Juice in your mall's food court, it's also been used to perk up the value of many a voyager in Timelines. Unfortunately that's not a big factor for FTP Spocko who was borderline in that area on release and has been retired from service on most rosters.

The meat of many Spocks' value lies in events. The Spock Empire is featured fairly frequently and his variants always have a bevy of plus traits, including Vulcan which has collected multiple megas and standalone bonuses already. Tack on some mid-level collection value and Spock has at least a couple arguments for immortalization once your fusion gold is finished.
