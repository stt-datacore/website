Hay bale Data has a little juice in his voyage ability yet, though that's more of a supplement at this stage. His great trait lineup is this crew's engine and has both bolstered his event work and granted him a spot in the biggest collection in the game; Costume Party. Take note of his expensive build cost including a fistful of Sec 31 items, but he will pay off the investment when finished.
