Imagine the previous global gift Seven in Silver grew a third leg and became voyage-capable. Terrible and graphic analogy aside, their shuttle work is roughly similar. But despite a very handy voyage ability, MMMBop sensation Annika may miss out on some Borg trait goodness down the line, courtesy of Star Trek: Picard.

Mid-range (for a newer crew) in the areas of base, voyage, and events, Ms. Hansen is a fine pickup for those looking to acquire her for purposes of character or art, but lacks a top-end metric or unique offering.
