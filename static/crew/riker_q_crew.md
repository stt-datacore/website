The William Riker legacy. Is it that he relinquished the incredible power of the Q for the sake of his friends? Is it the way he swings his legs over the backs of chairs and women? No, it’s this big, fat DIP base! By now you don’t need to be told that the skill set is redundant and he offers squat in several areas such as the arena and gauntlet where his proficiency total is behind over a hundred green and blue rarity crew.

But we’re in the middle of Rikermania with this particular variant snagging FOURTEEN event bonuses over the course of 2019 and 2020. You can feel the heat coming off Victorian Pulaski’s cheeks from here as RiQer lines up even more of his traits for future event work.
