Raise your hand if you like strong, kick-ass characters in your Star Trek. Now, keep those hands raised if you like to see that likeness and subsequent skillset ported over to the Game. OK, last question – do you like really good Legendary cards that happen to be Mega recurring Golds?

I hope your hand is firmly up in the air, as Valeo Beta V La’an is here and it cannot be argued that she’s the best Mega Legendary we’ve seen in ages.

Out of the gate, a killer Voyage score that is only bested in her SEC/CMD/ENG Triplet by Chances Taken Kirk – so that’s high company if you've even unclocked him yet. Then, if you’re not convinced enough, how about *nine* AM Seat matches? Still not? What about one of the highest ATK Crit bonus Ship abilities, with no trigger?! 

Sold? You should be.

Drawbacks? Uh, well, you see...

OK fine – she has one collection at debut, but four more should hit in the near and not-so-distant future. La’an as a character doesn’t see many events, but I’m sure we will all be Desperate to use her in an upcoming Mega arc.

Otherwise, amazing card for an amazing actress and character – make sure you get your four ‘free’ copies!
