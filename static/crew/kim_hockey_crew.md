Despite whatever neat portrait Topps has graciously given Kim for his frankly awesome card art, this right winger will never be cool enough to hang out with the ladies during Saturday cadet missions or with Morn on Sundays. You're primarily looking at two points of interest here, the first being some quick arena damage if you can supply a position trigger. Secondly, a collection smörgåsbord, including all his viable traits, which was previously unrealized the last time we wrote up his note. Well done, Harry. You finally lived up to your potential.

P.S. Kazon furs? What? Culluh me surprised.
