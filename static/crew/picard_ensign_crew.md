Sporting a strong CMD base and suspiciously shiny portrait, this particular Picard is currently a bit of a letdown as a reward for those multi-day voyages. Without collections (yet) or a more robust set of traits, you're really only looking to this card for event work. His CMD base is tops among Picard super rares, but when you have page after page of variants like Sir Patrick does, that somewhat blunts its impact.

Still worth holding onto on the off chance that a voyage exclusive collection hits, as it can take a ton of effort to get this crew to fully fused.
