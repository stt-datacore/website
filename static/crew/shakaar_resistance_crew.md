Lucky to escape the drawing board with some non-standard traits, Shakaarâ€™s CMD base is reliant on stray trait (mega) events, or perhaps another re-run of his feature. With zero daily value, we can really only hope that his traits slowly push him up the rungs of different value metrics as he becomes a multi-collection offering.
