Beehive Dax is the absolute epitome of event crew. With basement-level voyage numbers and no Gauntlet use, many players coming new to Dax may find her dead on arrival for daily use. But an astounding SIX separate event features with a skyhigh Dax event count on top of that, you’re going to be thawing her several times a year. Arena evasion earns her niche use elsewhere, but this Dax is a weekend warrior, first and foremost.
