"Captain Benjamin Sisko sat looking out the window…" Thus begins the greatest story ever told, as Benny Russell toils late into the night to write the words that will lead us out of the darkness and onto the path of righteousness.

Leaping out of one of the greatest episodes in Star Trek history, the Night Writer brings Brother Benny a deserved Legendary Variant. He emerges from behind his typewriter with a classic debut BigBase™, pipping “The Emissary” for top DIP Sisko variant. Another classic is crew debuting with similar stats as other recent additions, and here we find Benny again mirroring “The Emissary” as a DIP/SCI Voyager with great marks, though they have different third skills which help to separate them in the overall Voyage rankings and utility. That being said, Benny’s time will come with seat selection thanks to being one of the stronger options out there for a number of common traits, relegating him to perhaps a “nice to have” Voyager unless you are missing the aforementioned Sisko and the newly dropped Lela Kira.

If you are missing “The Emissary” then this variant will be a rockstar for Sisko Events when he isn’t busy Voyaging. With traits that fill spots in 3 Stat-Boosting Collections so far, he has the potential for a few more down the line (Far Beyond the Stars when? Writer perhaps?), however so far it seems like only Inspiring has been called to the front for weekend shuttle work and we may have to rely on the Captain’s variant history instead.

With no Gauntlet or Ship Battle potential to speak of, that pretty much sums up Night Writer’s use in the game, leaving him with ample time to keep typing away, in hopes of one day overcoming the adversity he so cruelly faces and getting his story told.
