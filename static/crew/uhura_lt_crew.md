Fro-get what years of stomach-churning Uhura variants have taught you - this version is actually pretty good! You can still see most of her stat ranks without scrolling down the pages of a spreadsheet, which can be rare for someone with her skill set.

The downsides are obvious; skill set, limited event chances, and "Afro Pick Sold Separately!", but you can only ding a crew so much who boasts the sort of base and voyage power that Uhura does. If you collect the requisite number of stars, she's guaranteed work for you, even if she promises not to age as well as her namesake.
