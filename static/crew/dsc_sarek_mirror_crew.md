One has to wonder if The Prophet saw his slow descent into rocky behold territory coming, or if that one caught him by surprise. Regardless, he's one of many event/collection combo platters, the sort of which players will encounter regularly in beholds.

Perhaps the greatest four-year event stretch in the history of the game came from Prophet's 2017-2020 run. Discovery inflated that to a certain degree, but his traits (and variants) must be on WRG's mind. It's not reasonable to expect that level of sustained dominance, but with worthwhile shuttle skills and few collections already locked in, he's a fine behold choice who you shouldn't be disappointed to acquire.
