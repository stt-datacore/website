WRG heard you love Greg Itzin, and you want a better way to get a representation of him in the game other than the near-impossible to get Admiral Black from Voyages.  And boy did they listen!  Enter now – Hain – in a Tuesday mixed behold pack featuring sticky fingered bandits.

Short and good: Hain is a great Super-Rare Voyager, debuting at rank 23 and only behind another Tuesday Purple Powerhouse (TPP) – Melora Pazlar.  Hain brings 4 matching seat traits to the table, and a great ship ability for those who love Nightmare Mode :TM: with a 350% Instant Damage (behind a trigger).

Short and bad: Hain only exists in the Criminal Mind Collection at launch but does hold the hope of 3 other potential entries.   No real Event use on the future roadmap for Happy Haim Havers, instead he’ll likely find himself frozen amongst Morn where they can talk about, well, lots of things.
Verdict? If you want Greg Iztin, keep voyaging.
