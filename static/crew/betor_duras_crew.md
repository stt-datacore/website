Her equipment list is awash with faction items and her build includes two gold items. Without a third skill, her voyage ability is hard capped too. So why would you want a crew who seems so repulsive?

Chapter one is cadet work. Full weekend eligibility makes the build cost easier to swallow, but it's her unique combination of strong proficiencies and traits which refund the price of admission. 

Saturday's Breakwater cadet mission (you know, the one that you can ad-warp for double premium packs) sees B'Etor tackling three nodes by herself. With the help of any competent CMD crew, you'll unlock a mission that you can farm every weekend as one of the best sources of credits in the game.

Chapter two is the fusion dance. Combined with sister Lursa, the duo form a super rare crew who lacks in most areas, but has an outstanding shipboard attack boost for new players. Requiring only one rare crew to build and a fistful of fusion fodder, The Duras Sisters are worth tying up a few extra crew slots to bolster your ship's weaponry for the arena and skirmishes.
