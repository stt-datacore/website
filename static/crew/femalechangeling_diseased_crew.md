One of the better 4* crew to come out of the Dominion mega, it's fair to say that Goldmember's sister is an example of how super rare crew can easily outstrip their legendary equivalents in terms of a return on your investment. Tertiary MED, a 6 second Attack boost, spirited Gauntlet pairs, and overall fair event potential (6 Dominion + 1 Brutal) keep her from falling into the same doldrums as her 5* equivalent.
