Providing the all important +1 Cockatoo to your roster, the good Lady Beverly has amazing art, but a mediocre event tally without Crusher’s usual Physician collection to soften the blow. Hologram may net you some events, though the trait’s best days are behind it. MED scarcity means you might hold on to her for longer than similarly stock crew, but she’s just not special in any area.
