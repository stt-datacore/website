After dodging Torpedo McCoy (and with an eye on Galordon Core Geordi and Mine Defusing Ezri), Rabbit remains one of two legendaries in the game (Imprinted Archer) to have ENG and MED as its top two skills. Which means that for that voyage combo, at least, he has a hind leg up on the competition. For the accompanying SCI/MED and ENG/SCI runs, he's going to contribute a tertiary skill that's often lacking in those crew. In short, his skill set and particularly skill order is great and will serve to inflate his voyage value. Rabbit's holes are certainly substantial, but you'll still see plenty of daily use from him even if he's lacking elsewhere.
