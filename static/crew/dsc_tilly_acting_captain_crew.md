Tilly has yet to experience a significant bump in event features since the presumptive fall of Discovery megas, so although her CMD base will be an easy un-freeze candidate for many rosters, those thawpertunities have been few and far between; on the level of Sulu and Scotty. The situation isn't improved by a somewhat thin trait set whose sole standout is Inspiring - a good trait to have as it scores her a spot in the currently difficult collection.

The other attribute of note is a not-quite-great arena ability whose boost is substantial for a super rare, but can be found on crew with better initialization and duration times. Certainly some use here, but not a terribly titillating Tilly.
