Maybe the most well-rounded 2-skill legendary in the game could remain that way for a while as WRG has dialed back those types of releases, presumably for sales reasons. 

His SEC/ENG proficiency pair is number one in the gauntlet and he has two usable bases for event work. A rich and intriguing trait list augments both as Auggie's event history is more machine than man and a whopping five 45% gauntlet sets give him a legitimate claim for gauntlet consideration. His single SEC roll can pick up plenty of wins with that amount of crit while some 2-for-1 situations against Caretaker or Gary Seven will be a cakewalk. 

The sizeable cherry on top is his collection value, again powered by that great lineup of traits. With a spot in the Originals collection all sewn up, he has a massive value ceiling in this area and is more than worth the behold capital if your other options don't include daily use mainstays.
