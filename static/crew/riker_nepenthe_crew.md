The first Picard cadet and coming from what is the most heart warming episode of Star Trek ever! A top 20 voyager with top scores in the DIP/SCI skill pairs and a smile and warmth that makes a grown man like me want him as my dad. The bases are high enough to score him some shuttle seats and knock out a few tricky DIP nodes on the mission map. Just don't let him burn the Bunnycorn Sausages!
