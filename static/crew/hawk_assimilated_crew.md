"Mr. Hawk...what are you doing in such a filthy uniform?" There's some fanfic we're happy didn't materialize. Uh, it doesn't exist...right?

Voyage work is likely to be Hawk's calling card, where a pinch of SCI solidifies strong stat ranks to create a facsimile of Mirror Jean-Luc Picard which outdoes the original. A great pair of shuttle-friendly SEC and CMD bases have done alright for themselves in the past, but without any variants to cushion the droughts, he may disappear on event shuttles for long stretches.

He's also roughly halfway through his collection profile if one was to assume that WRG will try to include most all traits. A worthwhile contributor in multiple areas - if you still need a legendary to finish one of his collections and Hawk is an option, "Make it so".
