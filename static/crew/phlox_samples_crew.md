In pure MED numbers you either have Dr Phlox or you have Nurse Kes. Both have great MED stats for a 2* and both can do well for Cadet Missions. Phlox has the edge with a collection addition mind and will get daily use before some of the better 3* crew drop and level up. He’s a consistent performer.
