While we were running around wearing masks and getting vaccination certificates, 2021 unleashed another more insidious plague; four Wesley events. He nearly doubled his variant event tally in a single year and does have a few traits that will likely provide future chances for him to flex his awful bases on weekend shuttles.

Usable shipboard evasion exists for superfans, but that’s where the good news ends until we get a prodigy or [whatever trait] collection down the line. If you want to get an A, pass on Wes.
