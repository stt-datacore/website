Twilight Reed seems to be trying to hitchhike his way towards being a useful crew. We aren’t sure if he’ll be able to, with that oddly-shaped digit. Short thumb-shaming aside, the first Legendary crew in the Temporal AgENT:™: Mega (you saw it here first, people!) is worse than being aggressively average, but he’s arguably the best Reed in the game, sharing that dubious title with EV Suit Reed. But he’s got a new hat, I mean, beard! Other than his Ship Ability, which is a 25% limitless, triggerless Hull Repair with a 24s cycle time, he doesn’t have a lot else to offer. If you’re a newer player and don’t want to spend a lot of time retrieving stars for Dereth or Laborer Kirk, who are the primo models in the HR meta, snagging a star or two for Reed in his sure-to-be-noncompetitive debut event and citing him up from a quarterly honor sale might be quite the coup for your FBB setup.

That’s what’s good about Reed. What’s middling to bad are his voyage power (debuting worse than rank 100), gauntlet (zilch), event prospects (Reed events are like… never ever), and collections (2 out of the box, perhaps 1 more later), and his CMD base (big, but a dime a dozen). Don’t get me wrong, it’s a super cool episode of Enterprise, where everyone is older, Archer can’t remember stuff and has a Vulcan haircut, and every crew is titled “Twilight …”, but it’s nice to get another Reed. Isn’t it? Is it? I don’t know.
