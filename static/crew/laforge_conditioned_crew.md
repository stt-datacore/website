One of several ENG/SEC names to join the game in a 2019 run on the skill pair, Geordi can hold his own alongside them. Top five for both his voyage skill set and the ENG/SEC pair at large, he's a fine compliment (or substitute) for former mega Determined Janeway. Beyond that, he chips in a sturdy ENG base which is noticeably stronger than still-good variant La Borg. His other attribute of note is a good-not-great ship ability which grants you a chunk of crit bonus at four seconds. In the race to shorten the Skirmish grind and avoid all manner of arena hazards, it's a valid option to wield.

A note about Geordi's event history; it's weird. After four consecutive Expeditions to kick off his Timelines career, there was a question about how his future would look with that event type out of the picture. He's responded with three out of four Skirmishes - not ideal if you're looking to gain value from your crew's bases on the weekend. With a handful of non-eventable traits beside, you'll be counting on his great daily work to mask a weekend question mark.
