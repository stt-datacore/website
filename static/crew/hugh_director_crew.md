A Jonathan del Awesome character that for many long time Trek fans was one of the highlights of Picard’s first season. Hugh debuted as merely OK statistically, which doesn’t usually cut it after the laundry machine agitator of Power Creep™ has taken a crew through a few spin cycles, but there’s mid-level usage in a few areas.

Well-rounded to a respectable degree, between a possible ceiling of four Collections, Trait-based Event bonuses, and even a few ‘screw it’ 45% Gauntlets, Hugh falls right into the Retrieve for Fun *and* Money section of crew.
