“Why are we still here?  Just to suffer?”

A question that can be interpreted in so many ways, but let’s focus our energy on the task at hand – Assimilated Rooney.  Focus.  Don’t get distracted easily, eyes forward.  Don’t glance over at that artwork.  It’s not that bad.  We’ve had worse.  Just don’t make eye contact.  Look down.  Oh god, she’s got an articulated knee joint like an action figure....OK don’t look down, just look at her hands, they can’t hurt you.  Oh god, she’s got four fingers total, just like a Simpsons character....you know what, go ahead and make eye contact.  It can’t be that baaaa OH GOD.  She has no soul.  But her art looks so soft and peaceful, so it isn’t OH GOD NO I’M BEING ASSIMIL........

.......
