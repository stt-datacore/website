The top ENG base for common crew just above the much maligned Ensign Kim is merely boilerplate for a crew who's a one-stop collection shop. Enemy Lines Torres is the only common crew to own a spot in each of her three stat-boosting collections, meaning she is an automatic immortalize until the end of the game. And while it's tempting to do so early on thanks to her cadet eligibility monday through friday, she's also rated as one of the three most difficult common crew to level.

An absolute diamond in the rarity rough who may need to wait a little while until new rosters can support the leveling (and replicator) cost, but worth the effort for players at any stage of the game.
