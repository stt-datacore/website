Astro showed up just in time for Sulu's first two events and the Pilot mega. If he helped carry you to victory those weeks, you might have a rosy picture of him in mind, but the numbers aren't as flattering. Sulu's historically been an event dud and though Astro's top two bases both rank #1 for the character, they're not good enough for daily use otherwise. His voyage numbers sit near the bottom of most metrics and although he has a top 15 SCI proficiency, the ranks above him are littered with gauntlet regulars who will outperform him. With all that said, he's actually the second best Sulu out there, but that only serves to highlight how little DB has given the character to work with.
