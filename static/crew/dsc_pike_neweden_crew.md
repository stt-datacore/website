Locked, cocked, and loaded since the Big Book was a twinkle in my eye, we can finally proclaim; Headin' out to Eden, Yeah Brother! 

While the demise of Disco Mega Events may have been prematurely declared, Pike's main squeeze Strange New Worlds is revving up and though we're unlikely to see the kind of Mega Event dominance that Discovery provided, at least Pike himself should see many more variants coming our way. NE Pike is not a special card at this stage of the game, but has some utility and is a fine mid-level Legendary Behold option.
