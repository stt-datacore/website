"Maybe I wasn't clear about the terrible pain part?" Little did we know that Jess Bush was actually talking about the six pack experience, and not her prescribed course of jury-rigged genetic metamorphosis. Even if you ignore missing out the most slam dunk Jury Rigger trait in the game, Strange New Worlds' first Chapel misses the mark almost everywhere. The skill set is a win, but with only 46 raw voyage points in Chapel's favour, she's not a sizeable enough upgrade over Medic Reno to justify the expense of shelling out Dil when you can just retrieve Discovery's ensemble dark horse instead. The value just isn't there - and considering voyages are all she has, that's a bad sign. When we've been dining on a diet of uber-Torres' and Hollow Datas, this less than subtle copy-and-paste just doesn't really cut it. Keep your chin up, Chapel aficionados. There'll be other, better variants to come.
