Mitchell is a Gauntlet experiment that failed before it began. Out of place item and proficiency ranges "are as intended", but stand at odds with a crew truly usable in the Gauntlet. If minimum rolls didn't exist, Antaak and 1-skill Chapel would be marauding around regularly. In the real world, where Gauntlet's coin flip nature is already frustrating enough, you would be doing yourself no favors by bringing 'the bad Gary' along. 

A true to life Trait set unfortunately doesn't do much to buoy Mitchell's rolls; he only catches a single 45%+ gauntlet, during which will be the only time any of his proficiency pairs sneak into the top twenty. A letdown elsewhere as well, his Traits trigger no Collections (yet), have him behind multiple Antimatter options in every possible seat on Voyages, and only Pilot has provided more than one-off event work.
