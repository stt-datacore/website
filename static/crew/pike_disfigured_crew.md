Beep Beep...okay Iâ€™ll leave that joke alone. A reasonable DIP crew that will hit a few nodes for you but outside of that his use will be limited. No cadet mission eligibility and his small skill set makes him less useful on voyages. But he might fill out a shuttle or two and backup some other crew unlocking difficult nodes.
