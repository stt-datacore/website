What strange circumstances has caused a lover out of someone's imagination to appear in the game? He narrowly escaped the most beautiful betazoid ceremony, or barbaric depending on which side of the altar you sit, but he has arrived to fulfill his destiny all the same.

DIP/MED has really become one of the more stacked voyage pairs in recent months with nearly a dozen new entries within the last year, including the mega giveaway hitters such as Soji Asha, God Q and Lothario Q, the latter of which appears in Wyatt’s own event. So even if one was treading water with the recent trend of events there is a slim chance you do not already have someone equally as useful as our young star crossed lover.
That being said an 80s hairstyle and a padded jacket will hide some decent enough numbers to fly. A set of slight but useful traits will get him a seat somewhere which boosts a voyage and if you haven’t already committed yourself to a young starry eyed Tarellian then perhaps he might find some use on your plague ship of death
