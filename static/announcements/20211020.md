- A new voyage calculator is now available, you can now choose to use either the original calculator, or the Multi-vector Assault calculator.
- Multi-vector Assault may offer multiple different options of crew to aim for different goals (see the 'recommended for' reasons).<!-- end -->

Because you may be more interested in, say, guaranteeing your voyage reaches the next dilemma than in having that voyage run as long as it possibly can, the Multi-vector Assault calculator may suggest multiple lineups that satisfy different conditions. It uses a few new terms to explain these recommendations:

- **Median runtime** is the *estimated time* of a voyage lineup, which technically means the calculator thinks there's a 50% chance that the voyage will run at least that long
- **Guaranteed runtime** is the lower part of the displayed *expected range*. It means there's a 99% chance that the voyage will run at least that long
- **Moonshot runtime** is the higher part of the *expected range*. There's only a 1% chance that the voyage will run that long
- **Dilemma chance** is the percentage chance that your voyage will reach the next dilemma
- **Starting antimatter** is as it sounds: the total antimatter that the voyage starts with (ship antimatter included)

The Multi-vector Assault calculator has one option at this time: **estimator threshold**. This is the new calculator's way of balancing between speed and thoroughness, similar to the original calculator's 'search depth' option. Set it low (0.1) if you just want a really quick recommendation; the lineup suggested here may not be your best option. Set it high (1.0) if you want the calculator to make sure it's giving the best median, guaranteed, and moonshot times. Most users can leave this option set to 'Auto.'
