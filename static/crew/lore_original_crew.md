His best (and perhaps only) attribute of note for most players is a handful (4) of previous big bonus features in Faction events. Certainly worth a thaw if he catches more, but otherwise he can only boast fast arena evasion if you find yourself being stomped in the arena like a late harvest Chateau Picard.
