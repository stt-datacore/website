A Spock-adjacent character once again sees his famous quote rearing its inconvenient little head, “After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting.” Platonian Chapel found that out the hard way in her episode and may be paying that lesson forward to rare skill set connoisseurs.

Bottom line brass tacks: Chapel is a fine voyager on day one. Perhaps even better than fine as she’s a (half hearted) skill order power refresh on two golden oldies in Twilight T’Pol and Dr. Kathrine Pulaski who, on many rosters, have continued to make voyage runs for far longer and with weaker stats than the vast majority of other skill sets in the game can muster.

Chapel even debuts with the top power for her overall skill set with fantastic anti-matter chances to boot. Yet the missed opportunity of a mediocre raw score, at least in terms of new debuts, undercuts the hype for what could have been an all-star voyage name. (And don’t give me any B.S. about her not being a fitting enough character. If the top twenty is home to names like Sahil, Jameson, and Ancient Humanoid, then the First Lady of Trek has the bona fides)

As historical data has shown, a voyage power debut in the top twenty adds anywhere from three to five extra years of use compared to a release like Chapel who’s pre-aged into triple digit ranks. This note has spent a lot of space discussing that single attribute, but it’s likely to be the only one that matters for Chapel owners ninety-five percent of the time. A MED-led skill set (poor shuttle seating), event history littered with dud years, and poor-to-average collection profile all point her towards voyages. She may not elevate your voyage times into the stratosphere, but will carve out usability even as her voyage score rank reads “two hundred and something”.
