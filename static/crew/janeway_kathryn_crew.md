Look at that smugness. She sees you, new player, and she knows you need her. This iteration of the esteemed Captain Janeway will fill a few roles in the early game as both a Voyager and a Cadet-er (Starfleet and Female for the win!). For everyone else, she fills a handy spot in a couple of stat-boosting Collections and gives you another notch in the Uncommon one.
