Make no mistake, Klingon Quark is a toadstool, but he's a toadstool with *seven* previous event features and plenty of collectable traits, including the lucrative Klingon tag. Owning a crazy build cost, Quark's leveling lowlights include seventy Klingon house crests and the highest chroniton cost of any super rare crew.

You may not want to level him until right before another event feature or when you're on the precipice of one of his collection thresholds, but he's become a tempting crew for min/maxers looking to stack skill boosts in the mid-to-late game.
