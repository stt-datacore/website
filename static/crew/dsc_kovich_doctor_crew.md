It's not often that you get to play Six Degrees of Separation in Star Trek with a horror auteur like David Cronenberg, but weird happenstance has inflicted such awful things upon Trek before - see Melvin Belli in 'And the Children Shall Lead' - that it was about time it pay off in a positive way, too. Fans of Discovery were eager to see Kovich debut in game, thanks to his magnetic personality and bonafide star power, and let me tell you, he does not disappoint. Swinging right for the fences with a very attractive skill set and a strong MED base, Kovich has more than enough voyage juice to really impress - the most pessimistic projection puts his lifetime at over 4 years, and that's not even considering the fact that even arthritic voyagers in this skill set will see use long past the point where equivalent CDS crew have been shunted to the freezer.

If you really want to see some gorgeous metrics - you know, with the girl or guy's permission first - have a look down at the voyage tab, and you'll see that there are no direct competitors for Kovich. MED primary, MED/SCI PRI/SEC, any order of this skill set, nada, zilch, he is the singular best. Crew like King Ridley and Dexa may have had a slice of their cake eaten just a tad, but frankly, when the skill sets are all different and they're all this powerful, you aren't running just one or the other, you ideally want to be running all three when the skills match up - this is more of a direct upgrade over the older horses like Leonardo da Vinci or Dr. Van Gogh, and the best part is you get 4 stars for free!

Collection value is one of his more middling points at the moment, bagging just Exobiology and the upcoming Discollection, but WRG saw fit to give him some esoteric traits that could well see an expansion in their direction before they're done milking the collection cow. Investigator, Counselor, Interrogator - even Xenoanthropology, now it's not the sole province of Michael Burnham, could be in with a shot, and that's before you get into the potential for one off events or megas that drill into ripe traits like these, to say nothing of the fact that Disco show megas are a thing again.

There's no denying that Kovich owes a lot of his tier to voyage power, and the ancillary benefits are middling to meh at the moment. But there's plenty of potential to get better when you aren't just a bog standard HFS with a sprinkled Resourceful on top, and as mega crew go, he's easily up there with Barry Waddle or Determined Janeway (back in the day) in terms of just how much he's going to improve the average player's roster. Absolutely cite that last star, quick, before they think better of it and pump out another SCI/CMD/whatever voyage rank #100 - oh, hey, Bryce, hey, how's the family . . .
