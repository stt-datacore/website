We’re going to let you in on a little secret that Big Sanitation doesn’t want you to know - you can actually take the porta potty with you. That’s what it’s named after: portable potty. The more you know.

That’s not to suggest that Spock’s suit is full of 💩, in fact he’s held up alright for a crew with a statistically under the radar release. Still a viable voyage piece, his fistful of anti-matter traits and very underrated skill set should give him a longer leash in that area than almost any crew of equivalent power. His traits (including the hidden ‘evsuit’) also give him big boy collection potential and will certainly make him a future retrieval option for any players who were absent for his introductory mega.

If you’re looking for more long term value, check out his burly event history that’s as reliable as almost any crew’s in the game. Quibbles over raw base rank or competition among variants don’t carry as much weight when dealing with a crew who shows up with a bonus every other month - he should never hurt for opportunity.

With some new player proficiencies to help you crack into the competitive area of gauntlet, EV Spock hits the mark from a bunch of different angles and should have enough fuel in his jet pack to power up your roster for years to come.
