Command, Diplomacy and...Engineering? Max's uncommon skill set and acceptable debut voyage power made a few believers out of skeptics and while he has a while longer to contribute in that area, that's really his only needle-moving attribute.

With an Enterprise mega in the rear view, Maximillian Of The Woods is at the mercy of a painfully thin trait set for future Faction bonuses. No doubt you might hear some favorable stories from people who got him 4/5 from his campaign, but if you missed out, your justification to finish him when stronger crew come your way will primarily rest on the Diplomat collection.
