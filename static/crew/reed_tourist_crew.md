Perhaps the epitome of genericness. Sporting no collections, a bland ship ability, uninspiring bases, and a voyage total that doesn’t even try to impress, Reed’s goofy art is about all that’s notable about this filler fella. His event count is equally mediocre and it’s tied to the least popular Trek series. He might pop for a romantic mega down the line, but that’s likely to be his last multi-week help to your roster.
