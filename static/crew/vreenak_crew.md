No, I won't say it. And Vreenak isn't a fake, though certainly underpowered. We're unlikely to see too many Tal Shiar events, but his other traits have still underperformed in terms of bonuses and he may find some weekend shuttle work when you least expect it. Not that you'd want him flying your shuttles for...reasons. Vreenak is more of a character choice, but at least he hits a few collections and has a reasonable ceiling there if you take him to max for sentimental reasons.
