Rarely talked about outside of his couple of event features, but workable proficiencies and a plus skill set grants him 45% crit in three different gauntlets; great for new players.. He sucks up loads of Medical Experiments to equip, but tends to justify it with his early-mid game efficacy and spot in a stat-boosting collection.
