His last note called Nexus Kirk underrated - this one won't. While he does have traces of his former versatility, the power is simply not there. Scads of events go to waste for a variant with such awful bases that he'll rarely merit the thaw. And what could be usable proficiencies in the right skill set are in the wrong one and will butt heads with Balok far too often.

It's almost difficult to find crew without collections these days so even though you will level and freeze this crew eventually, you don't need to be in a rush to do so unless you're an early enough roster that you could use him in a gauntlet or two.
