Palmer's usability is fitting for her on screen role, but not the inspiring woman who played her. Anaemic traits more or less limit the Lieutenant to daily shuttle pilot (#1 'ENG and SCI') outside of an Explorer mega - a trait that was on a previous survey, but perhaps not very likely. There's no gauntlet work in sight and a combination of low boost and slow-ish activation make her arena hull repair a tough pill to swallow as well. Even if you're ENG deficient, this is a card best left to collectors.
