Springing, fully formed, from the pile of characters where you look at them and go, 'yeah, they were only ever going to be CMD/DIP/SUCK,' Brunt does at least have the decency to stand out in a few key ways. For one, Ferengi voyagers don't grow on trees, so he can duke it out with Stranded Quark for that usually vacated seat, asking Timelines players what they value more, gold-pressed latinum (raw voyage power) or their ideals (rare skill set). 

For another, he's at just the right power level where you'd still be using him in three years time if you were to finish him quickly, and his traits are unique enough that he isn't going to be constantly overshadowed by the new Human/Federation/Starfleet hotness as the race to replace the last #1 voyager with a new flavour of blandness seemingly intensifies over at the WRG offices.

The drawbacks should be familiar by now - the skill set is tired, and though ameliorated by his unique set of traits, it's still hard to get excited to see the little star, the little laurel, and the little phaser in that worn out order. His collection value is for the most part baked in, with Crafty looking like an outside chance, and Interrogator and Constable looking perhaps just a little too niche for all but the most determined of collection gamblers. 

Events are mostly confined to non-bonus shuttle work (for which I might be able to interest you in a certain tribble?) and the long requested, long imagined Ferengi mega, while Gauntlet would be DOA even before we got to the rolls with this skill set - let's face it, if you aren't an exclusive, you don't stand a chance these days. Brunt definitely isn't a crew for everyone - for that, go cite up the literal crew for everyone, Enterprise Pike - but for people who like their traits covered, their DS9 supporting cast played by Jeffrey Combs, and their haberdasheries on the third floor, Brunt is for you
