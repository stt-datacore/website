It's DOCTOR Noah. He didn't spend six years in Evil Medical School to be called "mister," thank you very much.

A unique case in the history of Timelines, this megalomaniac gets one more Collection spot than the rest thanks to being grandfathered into the Physician Collection when the Trait was merely known as "doctor". With a fistful of other Traits as well and a Vanity in tow, he's shaping up to be an excellent bit of Collection value with a massive ceiling of up to seven(!) Stat-boosting Collections. Come for the Sisko variant Events, stay for the Collections!
