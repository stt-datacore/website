One of the best voyage skill sets in the game marred by that tiny little caveat of having about a thousand crew ahead of him in raw power. This isn't 2017 anymore so don't go all soft lens on his dollop of ENG/MED - it's not hard to find better options, even if they only match a part of his skill set.

Long term he's at least serviceable with a mouthwatering smörgåsbord of traits and variant events to elevate poor bases enough to give him plenty of whacks at the requisition shuttle piñata. A late collection bloomer, Bashir has enough viable traits to see him potentially flare up in value down the line, much like his shuttlecraft.
