Still as condescending as ever to the cadets, Admiral Riker no longer has the bite to back up his bark. The old gauntlet powerhouse has been relegated to new player asset where garbage bases, bland skill set, and thin utility combine to make a frankly boring card. Now only effective in the lone gauntlet where he hits 45% crit and with few other eventable traits or avenues for contributing, it's not controversial to say that his best days are behind him.
