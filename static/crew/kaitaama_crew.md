Popping a number on voyages and shuttles isn’t necessarily what we want to see from Tuesday crew as the cost to fully fuse them is higher than your typical event offerings. Still, those are the dishes Kaitaama’s serving up and her value overall is contingent on them for now.

Without the HFS flotsam clogging up her trait list, it’s certainly possible her collection value grows in leaps and bounds along with some event work. So while this is a skippable card currently, keep an eye on what her traits do in the future and don’t feel bad about snagging a few speculative stars here and there.
