The Golden Goose for all areas of the game, Commando Crusher has aged like fine wine since launch. Still sitting comfortably in the #1 MED Base position, she’ll destroy most nodes she qualifies for (which, thanks to her diverse list of traits, is a fair amount). A triggerless 200% instant damage in ship battles makes her a must have for newer players in both Arena and Skirmish events, and even the elderly crowd will want to have her on hand for Fleet Boss Battles.
