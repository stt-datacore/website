Though not a special crew by any means, Agent Janeway is usable enough to be a value pick in certain beholds. The first thing to note is a recent stealth nerf to this card which removed her Section 31 trait. Not only has that trait accounted for four extra events (one per calendar year), but could be a huge factor in the future based on the way the TV winds blow. Going forward, her dual 1k bases will have to rely on Janeway events only, barring a Costumed mega. DIP/SEC is not an appealing voyage combo for prospective crew, but a tertiary SCI gives her somewhere else to sit, extending her life as an option on your roster.
