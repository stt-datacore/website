If we were playing word association, the phrase 'tier 10' would be heard before her name was even uttered. But Grilka can at least claim a spot in the massive, stat-boosting Klingon collection which makes her certifiably better than some of the head scratchingly terrible cards that exist. With half (2) of her traits having hit on event bonuses in the past and the Klingon trait granting her a modicum of value, Grilka might just be a crew you take so that you can tell yourself that it coulda been worse.
