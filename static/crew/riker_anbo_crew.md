We were at the beach
Everybody had matching towels
Somebody went under a dock
And there they saw a rock
It wasn't a rock
It was Anbo-jyutsu Riker

The Ultimate Evolution in looking goofy is an insta-freeze after he helps with a tricky Pilot/SEC node unlock, but Anbo offers at least some additional value. The Riker name brand and a slew of traits pair pretty well with the most common "and" seat on event shuttles to earn him a couple of thaws each year With a strong collection ceiling in tow, this is a fine low end behold pick for players who donâ€™t need daily help.
