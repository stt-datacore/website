Donâ€™t judge a card by the haircut his mom gave him when he was six (was 1996 just like that?). The skill set and handicapped arena work are bummers, but this card is an alright voyage piece early on if you have him fused and in tandem with intermittent Chakotay events and a handful of traits, he's a crew whose event pace has the potential to increase in the future. Owning a spot in the Costumed collection, he's a name to target for late game players looking to stack skill boosts.
