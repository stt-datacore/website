Torres is a narrow use card, commonly referred to as a screwdriver crew around these parts. With a workmanlike Event history and viable Base, you can expect to use her a few times each year while her modest Collection lineup has room to grow. More of a luxury pick than daily stalwart, but one that most rosters will find some kind of use for.
