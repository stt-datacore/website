If there's one crew we can count on to avoid the CMD/DIP/SUCK logjam, it's good ol' Doc. Wait...what?

This shuttle friendly version (NOT NAMED SCHWEITZER?) should have an easier time handling weekend work than looking for, say, a fifth MED seat in a Duelist or Hologram event and so even though Doc the character doesn't boast a vigorous event history on his own, this variant has enough traits to keep him relevant in that area over time.

Completely dead on arrival for daily work on voyages or in gauntlet, his only other redeeming quality is a trait set which despite a few obvious omissions is still deep enough that his collection ceiling is higher than most. Coming to players with pre-aged stats, missing traits, questionable art, and the most swing-and-a-miss of all names, Beowulf EMH is a failed job from WRG and players should only look to sink minimal capital into him as an escape hatch in particularly bad beholds.
