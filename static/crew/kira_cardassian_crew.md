The Cardie collection and huge event potential almost save horrific CMD/DIP/SEC numbers. Almost. This variant should continue to gobble up weekend bonuses, but her bases are too putrid to thaw for many rosters. Outside of her 65% gauntlet, sheâ€™ll pay back no investment up front, opting to pitch in months (or years) down the line with a collection profile guaranteed to grow.
