Rom's a sum-of-his-parts crew. 'Merely' a two-skiller, his value lies in an all-star lineup of traits and collections. On the event front, Niners Rom is one of the few crew who has a believable path to increasing his bonus rate in the future. A handful of his many viable traits have supplemented his event tally to date, though none through mega events, leaving a realistic chance for multi-week thawpertunities.

More tangible is a quartet of collections ranging from vanity to the expansive 100 threshold Costume Party. Pointing back to that trait set again, Bajoran or Athlete may join his collection portfolio in the future. There's not much daily use past the early game, but the value is there in other corners of this card.
