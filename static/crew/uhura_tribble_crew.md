🎵 Oh, on the starship Enterprise, Uhura's skill sets make us cry. The devs all fear that if we're wise, we'll ask for rarer crew.

At first, her art could hypnotize but then blandness will agonize. Her collection could victimize and rip your cites from you.

And that's why female astronauts, Oh, very female astronauts wait terrified and overwrought to find what WRG will do.

Oh, girls in space, be wary, be wary, be wary, girls in space, be wary. We know not what WRG will do.

Now from a mega event place, she comes with variant-best base. A-seeking out her Faction place, she fills shuttles for you.

Oh, Tribble's our new darling, our darling, our darling. Tribble's our new darling. We know how well she'll do. 🎵
