The card is whatever. You should only be using them for rare events and some out-of-left-field collection value down the line.

This is now a Charlie note. She was my kitty, passed away in 2022. You can find some footage of her curled up on my shoulders during a stream just like Book & Grudge. She was a huge thing, probably as big as our other two cats combined, but such a gentle giant. All the neighbors knew her and saw her walking all over the neighborhood with her sister Pie. Black and white, derpy face. I love you, Charlie.

B&G is a fine crew if you want to immortalize your bond with your Queen or King in game.
