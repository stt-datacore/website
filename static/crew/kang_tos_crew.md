A difficult crew to rank in a vacuum, Kang's value (outside of the considerable value spot in the Klingon collection) rests on his arena ability. A massive attack boost when triggered from cloak makes him a singular name in the Captain's division of arena.That area is low-yield for rewards and not necessary to progress elsewhere in game, but his dominance there makes him a must-have if that's a part of your game.
