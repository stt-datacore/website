After the mission is completed, that crew will be disabled from doing Specialist Missions for some period of time.\n-- Specialist Missions take time to complete. The higher selected crew skills are the less time it will take them to complete a mission.\n-- Only the highest skill of a crew is considered when calculating time to complete a mission.\n-- Using crew with matching Specialist Mission bonus traits will significantly decrease time needed to complete a mission.\n-- Each time a Specialist Mission is completed, some progress is also gained on the Main Mission. Completing the Main Mission rewards substantial amounts of Event Victory Points.\n-- Using any version of Paris, K'Ehleyr, Torres, or Romantic crew will provide a chance to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission.\n-- When you fail to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission using featured crew or crew with matching event bonus traits, the bonus progress chance goes up slightly the next time you use such crew in a mission. If you score the bonus progress, the bonus chance amount goes back to its initial value. \n-- Community Rewards are also available during Phase 1 only. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock these rewards before the phase change!\n-- You earn Event Victory Points each time you complete a Specialist Mission or the Main Mission.
