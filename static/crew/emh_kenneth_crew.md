“Honey, I’m home!” 

One of the EMH’s many prospective names (and he never did arrive at one in the prime timeline, did he?) was Kenneth, when he created a holographic family in the episode “Real Life.” Adding this Doctor variant to the list of crew holding beverages, we must also add him to the top of the list of “Best EMH Variants”, since time has devastated the daily use ability for his older siblings like Warship EMA, Doctor Van Gogh, and even Indulgent Seven (notedly Beowulf EMH was never good).

In his futuristic briefcase he has enough room for his robust Trait list, which gives him not only a ceiling of six Collections, but also Antimatter Voyage seats numbering the same. Kenny has the power on Voyages to make good use of those seats, being among the top options for all but one of them, and slides in nicely between Devious Duet Jurati and Lady Audrey Chapel as the number two option for his triplet on debut, and is atop his Skill order by quite a bit over venerable Boothby Replicant.

While EMH Events are not plentiful (generally one or two a year), his Trait list gives him plenty of opportunities to score a weekend bonus, and while his SCI Base is strong, it’s likely his DIP secondary that will give him priority seating on your Faction Shuttles.
