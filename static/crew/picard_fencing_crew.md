"Number One, my voyage partner's cancelled for this afternoon. I was wondering if you wanted to join me?"
"Voyaging? I'm really not very good."
"It doesn't matter so long as you *tsch tsch tsch tsch* enjoy it." :)

Let's see how hard we can bury the lede. Picard catches a bit of flak for not towering over everyone else's event tally, especially considering his absurd number of variants, but he's notched at least two bonuses every year dating back to 2017. With a handful of traits to bolster his ability there and a skill set made for shuttle seating, he'll be a reliable weekend performer for years.

Those traits also give him a reasonable chance to expand his collection value, with his floor there being a spot in the ginormous Resourceful collection. They even give him a few bites at the gauntlet pie as he owns over twenty elevated crit gauntlets, including a few at 45%. Heavy skill set competition limits his effectiveness there, but it's a nice boon for newer rosters.

Seven of his eight traits even show up for anti-matter bonuses, which comes in handy for the number one freakin voyager! Braxton's thirty-four month reign as "The Only Crew Who Matters" has come to an end and despite Fencing's done to death skill set, his raw power is unmatched and will venture outside of the CMD/DIP/SUCK bubble more frequently than any other crew in his skill set. Fencing is a fairly well rounded crew and his astonishing voyage power alone is worth the price of admission.
