Crusher? I hardly know her! A formerly well-rounded crew, Bev's unable to hide her age to the point that the Mok'bara variant released in 2020 shocked many players by providing a "good Crusher". The plus skill set and minor gauntlet ability would be a boon on early rosters, but the fused numbers don't hold up to competition and the event work for Crusher crew or the Mirror tag will never be consistent. She might still be in consideration for the Mirror collection which boasts several putrid legendary crew, but as a standalone, she doesn't move the needle in the endgame.
