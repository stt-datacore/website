If I had a quatloo for every SEC/ENG/MED Klingon that hit the game, I'd have three quatloos. Which isn't a lot, but it is a little funny that it's happened three times. Torres has been aching for a refreshed variant for a good long while now, and it's fortuitous that Skydiving B'Elanna comes to us just as Delta Flyer begins to pass from relevance on voyages, if not in our hearts. Everything about this crew screams effort, from the superlative art to the choice skill set, even right down to a thematically appropriate ship ability, and everyone should be so lucky to have their favourite crew immortalised in such a way. For the collections fiends, two is a slightly limp number, with only a little wiggle room in her traits for more, but EV Suit has a few duds you want to avoid, so it's not a total wash. Really, this is a crew you take with you to the voyage bank, and make good on that investment for the next three years.

Out there in the starry sky, she has a different enough set of traits from her nearest contemporary, Prisoner Kim (or a terse, snarled "Starfleet!" if you're feeling nasty) that both will likely fly, but really, they could have the exact same traits and I'd still recommend you slot them both; power and uniqueness are rarely married this well. Her event profile is a little bit more lackluster, what with B'Elanna not really being what you'd call a Faction queen, to the point where Klingon and the occasional Athlete events are arguably more reliable shots at holding down a shuttle seat, but variants do happen, so consider citing her a small price to pay to keep from ever having to unthaw Klingon Torres ever again. Even if your Faction resources are tapped and you can only grab one copy, this is a crew that will age well and be worth citing, whether from a campaign or Honor sale, especially if you enjoy Torres' character arc or empathise with her struggles in this episode. A fan favourite done right - not unlike banana pancakes . . .
