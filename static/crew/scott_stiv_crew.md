Poor voyage numbers, poor event count, poor Scotty. The Doohan faithful may have to hope for some trait megas to rectify what DB refuses to and give a usable ENG base chances to pilot some shuttles. His niche +EV/instant damage in arena is available, but accompanied by poor passive stats and a slow start time, thus limiting it to new players only.

One would assume that his non-HFS traits both get tagged for collections in the future, but until they do there's almost no reason to behold Scotty.
