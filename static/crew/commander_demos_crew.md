Mr. Wacky Waving Inflatable would be a more impressive offering if not caught in a tortured Skill set as common as grains of sands on the beach, and since Power Creep™ has eroded away his Voyage viability, he’s left with little more than his Trait set. 

Aforementioned Trait set has a few weird ones that may find their way to Collections one day, but for now look for Demos to be a last-ditch choice in your Legendary Beholds.
