This handsome specimen is what's known in the biz as an "Eddington". Completely useless while we hold out hope for one of their traits to hit on something in the future. Instant damage on ships often catches the eye, but a cloak trigger is usually too finnicky to get working with auto-battle and there are a plethora of superior crew in that area to relegate the fish to nothing more than an introductory plug-and-play option.
