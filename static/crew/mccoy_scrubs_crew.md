For a card so old (Mid 2016), McCoy has had a hell of a run. DA has a rather flat stat distribution; sort of like a primary and two secondaries. Practically insignificant, but a callback to days of yore when stat distribution wasn't so cookie cutter.

Bones' four event features is an unparalleled number for non-mega golds, but although McCoy is a household name, he's not been a Faction event powerhouse and his aged sub-1,000 primary base is markedly worse than a few newer variants. Considering the universal lack of MED crew and such poor stats on the gauntlet focused ones, DA McCoy can still find niche work on some rosters, with a bias toward early-to-mid game players.
