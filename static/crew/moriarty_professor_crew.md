Stuck on Stat Island alongside numbskull Gilligan, The Professor's one chance off that hellhole is traits. One of the top ranked crew by collection potential, that metric will either hold solid or transition to tangible, stat-boosting goodness. In the meantime, feel free to pass on him for more immediately beneficial crew or freeze him if you've immortalized Moriarty since power creep has swallowed up any semblance of daily usefulness.
