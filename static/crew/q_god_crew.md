Qod was a baller when he came out. Big MED base, big MED voyage. He's still what he once was, just...less of it. We may not like to admit that our favorite stars of the Silver Screen get older, but they do. Even if this one literally played Father Time at one point. 

That being said, things aren't totally dismal. What he may have lost in daily use, he's picked up in collection value. And as the principal voice actor for Timelines, John de Lancie will always be a relevant figure, as evidenced by his handful of recurring mega cards. It's easy to shy away from Mega crew who others got for 'free', but Qod is still worth reeling in, especially in an otherwise unappealing behold.
