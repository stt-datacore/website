She makes, like, a gazillion voyages for me' - but we must strive to be less encumbered with horse blinders here at the Large Tome. 

A former mega recurring rarely gets bad reviews because more stars = more good. And it's true that Soji hit the spot on release and gave everyone a nice, juicy MED voyager. But what else did it give us? Not a gauntlet option or an event piece (crossed fingers for a show mega notwithstanding) or an arena option or much of a collection magnet, though she may end up average there over time.

As for her voyage ability, it's still cruisin' on rosters who FF'd her from her introductory mega, just keep in mind that her skill set is far from uncommon and the voyage power on the label is not what you're getting when you behold her first or second star - it will take a while to rev her up. Three anti-matter traits don't exactly inspire confidence against other MED-led options in her neighborhood either. 

Are we telling you to not behold her? Well, no, just weigh her same-day stats against the fantastic tales that usually accompany recurring mega crew. Soji is far from a dead end, but her edges are more sanded down now than they ever were.
