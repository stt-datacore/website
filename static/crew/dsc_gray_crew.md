Gray (and a few Adirae) is in line to benefit from WRG’s continued collection releases, but until such time he’s almost totally dead in the water. A pair of 45% gauntlets (which might appear once per month and probably on the other track) is the extent of his pre-cryo usability.

Offering only scant thawpertunities to date, Gray’s poor bases are often only marginal upgrades from either who’s already active for you or similarly frozen crew. We do like the future event and collection potential for all of his viable traits, but they’ll need to start popping off before he earns your behold capital.
