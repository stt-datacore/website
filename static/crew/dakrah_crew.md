A butcher of these skillsets amirite! No but seriously allow me to introduce the 140th member into the CDSci members club. He might look like a small targ in an ocean of "crew we couldn't work out what real skill to give a third attribute to so fuck it, SCI" but rest assured he'll find some way to be reeled in for the eventual voyage. 

Dak'Rah sits at the edge of usability, being one of two top voyaging Klingons in the top 100 isn't much to kling-on to but it's something. However the slow crawl to grab Chances Taken Kirk will push Dak out of the equation and the power isn't quite there to use for a bite sized piece of antimatter over the (currently) 13 other crew in his skillset that can outperform him. His saving grace is a meaty CMD/DIP combination that will no doubt get shuttle seats in any event, regardless of traits which he isn't too slim on either. There is potential for him to shadow fill some future collections too.

Can't help but notice Dak'Rah is missing the Athlete trait for his sweaty old man Mok'Bara practise but perhaps that will appear on a forthcoming variant. Perhaps "Flight Attendant Guest Star Shyaporn Praying Dak'Rah" will get it...
