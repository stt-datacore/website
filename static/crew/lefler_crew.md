Lefler's massive ENG and respectable top-end CMD roll makes her a fine Cadet helper on Saturdays, even though she's not eligible for Sundays as well. And as you'll want to level her eventually for her spot in her two non-Rarity Collections, it's not a waste of resources to do so early on. She lacks versatility otherwise, but Collections and Cadets are what you want to look for in low Rarity crew and Wesley's crush provides. For players making their way through Fleet Boss Battles in the Hard and Brutal Difficulties, she is perhaps the best Hull Repair option below the Legendary Rarity.
