Fake Tucker was born with some disappointing numbers that have only gotten lower. He's not quite usable day to day (or shouldn't be), but can make a case for himself as an event/collection combo.

Tucker has managed to squeeze at least one variant event in each calendar year out of a company that doesn't think much of the Enterprise series and a few of his traits haven't hit yet, but could/should. Similarly for collections, one of his current ones is a vanity, but he's quite likely to expand his grasp in that area before WRG's collection bonanza is all said and done.
