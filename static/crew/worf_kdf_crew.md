Civil Warf is a theoretical SEC base for Worf/Klingon faction events, but his blunted bases will cease to merit the thaw at some point in your Timelines journey. The same can be said for a 12 second 200% instant damage arena ability. His most enduring attribute is likely to be his spot in the huge Klingon collection which can be unlocked for a fairly easy build cost. A few points of interest here, but most will evaporate as your roster grows in power.
