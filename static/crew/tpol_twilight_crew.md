Think Defensive Phlox. Down arrow inside of the gauntlet, up arrow outside of it. In the rock, paper, scissors world of dice rolling, it doesn't bode well for Twilight to see Pufferfish Phlox ranked ahead of all of her gauntlet pairs, but he's not generally a crew you'll meet walls of. Established rosters may not be bringing her without a crit advantage - luckily, she enjoys the occasional 45% gauntlet and, regardless, will be a big boon for newer rosters or those who don't own the gauntlet's premier MED option.

Outside of the gauntlet, she's a step up in our comparison. T'Pol slots in as the second best voyager for her rather rare skill set and, in combination with a MED primary, will often contradict a disappointing voyage rank in practice. Five consecutive years of variant events, a Vulcan trait that still sits in the right bonus pool range for further work, and a debut mega all amount to above average weekend work, even if the bases of this gauntlet crew don't 'Wow'.
