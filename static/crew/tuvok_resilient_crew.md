Beginning to drop from voyage consideration on endgame rosters, BlinkVok still deserves fringe consideration there thanks to a fortuitous skill set and plenty of anti-matter traits, but is making the transition to event and collection piece.

WRG has been frankly disrespectful to Tim Russ' incredible, consummate Vulcan character. While traits have buoyed him to weekend relevance, Tuvok has averaged a measly one event per year for his variants. One can only hope the trait megas continue to roll while the studio wakes up and gives us a dozen more events for Tuvok and his great candle-making, cake-decorating variants in the future.

While we're holding our collective breaths, enjoy his multi-collection status with a little room for improvement in that area. Resilient is a fine mid-level behold option who should hold value reasonably well down the line.
