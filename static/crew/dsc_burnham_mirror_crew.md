A "solid" super rare Burnham - stop me if you've heard this one before. Her overstuffed skill set goes a long way toward neutralizing a strong on-paper voyage rank, but the DIP primary is not a lost cause for shuttles and joins Fugitive Burnham as the only appreciable representation of that skill for her (many) future events.

In addition to incrementally more interesting traits than your typical Burnham variant, the best element of this crew for newer players is a +9 attack boost on ships which comes online at six seconds and is an excellent medium-term Skirmish and Arena asset attached to a crew who you'd have to thaw regularly anyway.
