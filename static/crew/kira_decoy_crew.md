Kira’s role in this episode was to provide a distraction, and don’t let her sparkling art divert your gaze from her Stats, which are indicative of a 2019 release with CMD/DIP/SEC Skill set. Nerys has a stellar Event pedigree so you can safely choose this variant from a Legendary Behold and can feel good about it too. 

Four Traits so far have equalled a trio of Collections including her episode’s Vanity Collection, and look for two more to hit to give her a 100% clearance rate. Also one of the necessary Immortalizations to unlock Scapegoat O’Brien, Kira used to be a tough pill to swallow to get a formerly great crew. But with The Goat aging rapidly, you might want to just finish Kira on her own merits and let Scapegoat O’Brien languish as a Vanity goal versus a must-have crew.
