He’s not sure what to do with his hands, but we can be sure what to do with him - stick him on Shuttles! Between Riker's impressive Event clip and a strong CMD Base among variants, he should be one of the first crew out of the freezer when his character's number is called.

There's not much else for "real" use aside from his +9 Attack Ship Ability behind a Position Trigger, but he's already a multi-Collection piece with a few untapped Traits to improve his value there.

For just one crew slot and 39 cents a day, you can help provide warmth and shelter for Rikers just like this one. Call now. *I will remember youuuu*
