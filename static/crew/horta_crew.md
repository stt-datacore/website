Something of a starter crew, mama Horta is there to take care of your fledgling account in a few important areas. With a single star you're looking at reasonably fast and trigglerless arena damage along with a pair of 45% gauntlets attached to a respectable SEC/DIP pair, at least until you run into those Locutus walls.

Horta also has a few little collection nodules ready to hatch into value down the line. She started with Primal, a collection not likely to grow at an incredible rate so players of all ages will want to acquire her for that reason alone. Our vote for most adorable Caregiver in the game.
