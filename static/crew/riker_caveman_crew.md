In the vein of an Evil Kirk or 'Ultimate Evolution' Riker, Proto is a freezer body who you'll thaw a few times each year to boost your Faction shuttles. His shot at daily use lies in the arena and is a curious thing. 250% instant damage is almost as good as it gets for super rares without a trigger (Warship Yar 300%) and pairing it with a six second fuse is juicy, but it comes at the price of a hefty accuracy handicap. It's hard to know what to make of it in a vacuum, but should be worth playing around with if you aren't happy with your current setup. Many players do fine with just +7 accuracy from Ardra, so if you run with a +9/10 accuracy boost, Riker may help more than he hurts. The card isn't nearly as ugly as the character, but his use is fairly narrow if not utilized on ships.
