This master-of-none Picard variant will likely be eschewed by veteran players, especially those chasing the golden collection carrot. The object of Rikerâ€™s derision, Lt. Picard has scarcely more than his ship ability with which to make a favorable impression.

Newer players may find a bit more meat on the bone, but a severe lack of traits hamstrings him in every area except perhaps voyage anti-matter seating. This is merely a card who sells himself on the back of his appearance in the fan favorite episode Tapestry.
