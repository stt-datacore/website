One of the few Super Rares who is usable day to day into the mid and late game, Marshal owns the best CMD proficiency for a non-exclusive crew. Of course the hoard of overpowered exclusives generally marginalize everyone else, but that’s where Q’s trait set steps in, affording him a half dozen big crit gauntlets where he can dice roll his way to victory.

Those Quintessentially Q traits also grant him strong collection value. Already an easy pickup on that basis, he might sit at a count of six or seven by the time you’re reading this note. He’s not your typical shuttle or voyage option, but don’t pass on him solely because of his poor bases.
