"So there are two of them." Was Picard talking about [Redacted], his similarity to previous mega Surak, his crew art - 'Man and Dog in Two Dimensions', or the second copy of him you'll pull in the 390 dilithium recap packs? A question "best left to saints and philosophers".

Pup-card's numbers are eye-popping. The #1 base SCI won't only claim regular shuttle work, it puts to shame global gift Mambo and campaign freebie Irumodic for event work which has been just above average to date, but is likely to blossom over the next few years.

His voyage potential ain't too shabby either. The wrinkle here is a common skill set which boasts several high-powered options on voyages already. That's notable for endgame, spreadsheet-crunching voyage purists who are looking at the 11-12 hour voyage range, but not at all a warning. Take the power, enjoy the power.

In the running for best mega crew to date and batting 💯 in a handful of areas, your options for Picard going forward are insta-cite or roll the recap pack dice and feel okay about building another copy. But I swear, if I see you post a citation advice thread and he's not sitting there fully fused, I'm coming after you!
