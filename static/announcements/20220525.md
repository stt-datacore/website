The [Shuttle Helper](/playertools?tool=event-planner) in the event planner player tool has a brand new look!<!-- end -->

This updated version of the Shuttle Helper puts a greater emphasis on picking better shuttles and crew, and less focus on creating/maintaining shuttle setups. It also includes an oft-requested feature: automatic import of shuttle missions from your player data.

The optimal way to use the new Shuttle Helper is to:
1. Open all shuttle missions in-game at the start of the event
2. Upload your player data to DataCore's [Event Planner](/playertools?tool=event-planner) player tool
3. Select the missions you want to run in the Shuttle Helper
4. Hit 'Recommend Crew' to get automatic recommendations for your selected missions

You can pick different missions and rearrange crew assignments to balance shuttle success chances as you see fit. The new crew picker also shows how changing an assignment will affect shuttle chances.

You only need to import shuttle missions once; after the initial import, the Shuttle Helper will remember all the missions for the rest of the event, though you will of course need to upload your player data on subsequent visits so that the Event Planner can see who's on your current roster.
