One of the cheapest crew in the game to level chroniton-wise, but requiring a handful of Vulcan faction items. Boasting the lowest SCI primary in the game means that Mister Tuvok is merely around to light the match on the Vulcan collection, making him a mandatory immortalize, but not a particularly exciting one.
