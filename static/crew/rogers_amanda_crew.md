A case study on why debut numbers matter - Amanda premiered to quite a bit of interest, thanks to an ENG/MED skill set for voyages. But not too far removed from that, she's become a liability in that area. Her utility elsewhere may have taken the lead on this card's value - collections (of course), occasional event shuttling, and strong arena EV at six seconds which, like her time on screen, you may wish lasted a bit longer.
