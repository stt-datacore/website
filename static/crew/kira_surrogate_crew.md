In a year of multiple new #1 voyagers, a completely unrecognisable voyage score top ten, and the complete blowing out of the later losers curve, it says something that right at the end of the year, Surrogate Kira may well be the best one yet. The skill set is choice, the character pick is steeped in that fine DS9 shine of moral ambiguity and danger, and both the power and traits are there - just like Orbital Skydiving Torres before her, this is the variant that all Kira fans have truly been waiting for. If you're still running Warship EMA, Mirror Culber or Fury Kes on voyages, this may well be their death knell, to say nothing of voyagers like Rescue Team Uhura or EV Suit Worf that were hanging on despite lackluster skill sets or power thanks to obscure traits like Marksman. The Grim Reaper comes to Timelines, and she's packing a Bajoran phaser and 8 pounds of baby.

Outside of voyages, Kira is a respectable event name, picking up four or more a year outside of brief dry spells in 2018 and 2022, meaning that even though her SEC base may roll just outside the top ten, you'll still put her to work on shuttles, and given that these bases are stacked so close, she's actually only 20 points off new #1 SEC base J'Vini, which is a very minor difference in the grand scheme of things. Her ship ability isn't quite good enough to stand on its own two feet - maybe it represents the baby in this card equation? - but it certainly isn't nothing, giving a decent chunk of crit bonus at a speedy 8 seconds. Kira also manages to achieve the borderline impossible in that all six of her traits are collections or collections viable, meaning this is a proposition with very little dross - no dead weight HFS, and, even more ideally, extremely easy to retrieve.

She even manages to throw in a non-zero in Gauntlet; granted, Fury Kes will still lay her out, but for newer players, or if you just like a 45% gamble with a card you'll almost never see, she could be fun to use there. Voyage all-stars should all be so lucky to have so much widespread utility - Kira's going to age like the finest of wines, and she's liable to outlast the game, her voyage projections are so rosy. So go grab yourself a copy, and while you're at it, write a scathing email to trektime@gmail.com, asking why a CMD/DIP/SUCK card like Lt. Commander Spock won their Crew of the Year award instead of this beaut.
