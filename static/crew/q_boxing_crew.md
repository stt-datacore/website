“I’m not Picard.” And then Q never visited DS9 ever again. Collections and events comprise the bulk of Boxer's value, but there's also a small window for arena usability provided you can meet his position trigger early or keep your powder dry with manual battles until you can. Without a ton more Qs available from the source material, his help in completing The Continuum collection should be safe for a while while he collects help from his other traits.
