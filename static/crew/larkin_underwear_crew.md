Larkin's second variant is essentially a carbon copy of the first. A thumb on the scales tipping more power to Underwear's Voyage score is pointless as it's still horrible, so you'd probably prefer Edward's better base if given the option. Regardless, both cards are primarily Collection fodder with the occasional Event bonus, even if blanket Discovery Mega Events are a thing of the past. If you choose to invest in this pantsless idiot, you shall be rewarded by not one, not two, not three, but four Collections, and Traits for up to two more.
