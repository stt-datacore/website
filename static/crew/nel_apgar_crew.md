Can’t you just hear the bell dinging as Hector Salamanca himself, Nel Apgar, comes rolling into the game in the January 2023 UberKampaign!?

(Breaking Bad Spoilers below) 

Look out, Gus Fring!  Don Hector has BLOWN UP his skill order upon release - granted his closest competition were decrepit Legendaries like Away Team Burnham, and Mademoiselle de Neuf, but more notably in his SCI/SEC/ENG triplet he easily eclipses recent additions like Mestral and Angel BurnMom, as well as slightly more venerable voyagers like Worst Dad:™: Leucon, and Tactical Stamets.  And what’s more, he has an amazing set of Antimatter traits (six), which he is going to further use to steal seating from all of his direct voyage competition.

Did you miss “empty base” Lt. Commander Bryce in a recent event?  Well, that’s fine!  Don Hector has the new #2 SCI base just behind his predecessor, if that’s your bag.  He’ll find plenty of weekend action on non-bonus shuttles and his plethora of traits will surely add more event use.

A few places where Apgar falls short at the moment is ship ability (+10 Accuracy at a slow 8s) and gauntlet use.

We did mention his traits earlier, and as of the writing of this note he only has two collections: the easily-finished “Criminal Mind” (Criminal) and the tough “The Daystrom Award” (Innovator).  BUT he’s got 2 more “viable” traits with Astrophysicist and Scoundrel which could easily see the light of WRG’s content train sometime soon.  And of course, we would be remiss not to mention he is the best Tanugan in the game!
