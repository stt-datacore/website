Phantom of the Opera Jr. is a one trick pony. Gauntlet is the name of the game, where B'Elanna's secret admirer owns a handful of ranked pairs, including the #2 CMD/MED roll. That skill pair never (ever) faces walls - rather the only ones that you’re likely to see will be giving Sulan the opportunity to 2-for-1 Balok or Defensive Phlox.

His MED proficiency maximum is also third in the game if you enjoy soul-crushing defeats at the hands of RNG. His crit sets are limited to 25%, but with one of the more useful skill sets to avoid walls of gauntlet exclusives, he should perform better than “stronger” crew who will often be flipping 50/50 coins for their wins.

MED/CMD is the holy grail of voyage combos too, but Sulan’s power there is completely flaccid and his multi-collection status is merely middling by the numbers. The latter will serve as a consolation prize if you’re not a big gauntlet fan, but if you’re not using him there, he’s just another pretty face.
