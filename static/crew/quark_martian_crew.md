Rarely has a reduction made so much sense, except perhaps with Moogie's tube grub remoulade. Martian Quark is a string of traits with a bit of a weekend bump thanks to his name.

Nine traits with no Human, Federation, or Starfleet among them is an embarrassment of riches and it's beginning to show for Quark as his collection count grows. With a ceiling in that area as high as any crew in the game, there's zero shame in late game players stacking stars and gambling that WRG doesn't drop the whole "card collecting game" thing any time soon.

His traits have also done well to pad out an event history headlined by reliable contributions from variant features. DIP and CMD never have trouble finding seating, don't worry about what the naked base ranks might say. While only his 65% gauntlet represents any semblance of daily use, this is a post-immo powder keg who has already claimed enough value to leapfrog dozens if not a hundred other forgotten, older crew.
