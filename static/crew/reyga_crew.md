“All I want is to be acknowledged. Respected as a scientist.”

He’s got his wish, as despite being a Launch Day crew he is still one of the top SCI bases amongst Rares. This will fare him well in Sunday cadet missions but sadly the dearly departed Doctor has only 2 skills and sits amongst the dregs of Blue Voyagers. Timelines players with the lobes for Collections would tell you to level and fuse him up at the earliest opportunity thanks to the Ferengi Collection needing nearly every single one in game.
