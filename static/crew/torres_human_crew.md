I would invite you to flip back and forth between her stat page and Sergey and Helena Rozhenko's. Not the most promising first impression, but she does have a couple perks to help her escape obscurity. There's a huge gulf between her DIP and the next best Torres option (not you, mom), even at 1/5. Unfortunately, you won't be able to stretch that equity as far as you'd like since this version comes without the Klingon tag and Torres' event tally over the last 21 months sits at two. Jury Rigger is always worth a mention and she's not the worst option of those eligible, but if all you're chasing is a big, easily replaceable DIP base, it's best to look for one with more utility or event chances.
