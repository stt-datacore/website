Lumped in with the other purple Mirorr dregs isn't quite fair to this Uhura. A new collection has bumped her value up at the behold screen, but beyond that she does an Ardra-lite impression in the arena, grabs the occasional event bonus (with admittedly poor bases), and even owns four different 45% crit trait sets in the gauntlet. On the weak side due to age, but a must-have for a stat-boosting collection which brings her other offerings into the limelight again on young rosters.
