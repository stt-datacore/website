A great performance by Malcolm McDowell wasnâ€™t quite matched in game. Granted, we can't expect much from a 2016 crew and at least Mr. Cool Guys Hold Their Guns Sideways has a handful of traits that may unlock more value in the future. Depending on how many collections he has at any given moment, you're probably fine passing on him in beholds and coming back around to Longcoat once you're looking for projects to fill out some higher collection tiers in the late game.
