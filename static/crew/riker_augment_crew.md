It's the trait/collection era and Auggie here proves the rule. His rich trait list will be contributing to boosts that push your gold crew higher and further even while he's chilling in cryo.

That being said, it's a big step down for Riker after that. While he has caught and will catch plenty of events and Riker variants are ENG-deficient, Auggie's bases are poor enough that he won't be worth the merits to thaw in some cases. His handful of big bonus features will grant him reprieve from time to time, but his usage is not a 1:1 ratio with his impressive event tally.

A note about his gauntlet ability; while it can be difficult to acquire worthwhile ENG rolls outside of exclusive crew, it's less about who you can field and more about who you'll be facing. His first star may earn him a couple of appearances for fresh rosters, but he can't overcome the kind of walls you'll see at higher ranks and his ability there should be considered a perk for early adopter collection chasers, rather than something to rely on.
