Formal Dress Benny Sisko once held the title of top SEC Base and upper echelon Voyage power for some time, but he’s since lost them both, finding instead a place among the top Collection and Event crew in the game. One of the gatekeepers to Scapegoat O’Brien (who has likewise sagged in value due to time and Power Creep), Sisko has three additional Stat-boosting Collections and Traits in tow to pop him up to a maximum of five, making him well-above average in that aspect of crew valuation.

Sisko is a blue chip Event name and all those Traits give him chances to cash in his chips for weekend work even when his name isn’t called for a variant bonus. Still-strong SEC Base will help him sit on your Faction Shuttles, and while his Skill set would be a liability on Voyages (if he was still being used there), SEC, CMD, and DIP are among the most common Shuttle seats. Gladly choose HR Sisko in your Legendary Beholds and thank us later.
