Is one of the finest admirals in the fleet a good choice for your roster? That's a stupid question.

Ok, that joke landed better on release, but Patrick is still a fine crew. Primarily a voyager, Pat will look to combat an ever-growing CMD/DIP/SCI skill set with reasonable overall power and a couple less common anti-matter traits.

Those traits also encompass his spotty event work and, more tangibly, a collection count that should land somewhere between two and four - not bad for a crew who you can still use outside of cryo from time to time.
