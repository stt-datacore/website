If only the numbers were as great as his episode. Geordi's skill set is usually a boon for voyages (note: he's a CMD primary despite what the behold screen says), but with a stat total sitting next to the 2-skillers, he's far from a sure thing.

In fact, his only notable strength is a variant-best CMD base. Multiple event features is typically a great attribute but his feature and subsequent re-run were Expeditions, which have all but been phased out. With woeful daily contributions, you'll want him as a luxury event pick only.
