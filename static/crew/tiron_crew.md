A checklist filler so that we can round out our second “Oops All Jeffrey Combs!” Event in the game's history, Tiron is of a befitting power level and usefulness for one of the most beloved Trek character actor's first roles - which is to say, ew ew ew, Fuse and Forget. As lacking in nuance as he was perverted, Tiron's big Base comes attached to only two halfway viable Event Traits in Merchant and Scoundrel, which are also his only potential Collections unless Serilian wins on that outside shot. Don't leave him in your Crew Quarters for a moment longer than you have to.
