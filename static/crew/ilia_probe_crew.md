In the five years since this card has debuted, she's caught two Events and two Collections. Not exactly an enthralling return on investment for Immortalizing a Legendary crew. The latter of those benefits is sure to balloon during Toyota Trait-a-thon (God help us if we get a Probe Collection), but until she's the best option in the worst Legendary Behold you can think of, ignore her and her oath of celibacy.
