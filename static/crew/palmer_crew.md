Palmer's usability is fitting for her on screen role, but not the inspiring woman who played her. Anemic Traits more or less limit the Lieutenant to daily Shuttle pilot where her metrics are good, but she won't really shine outside of an Explorer Event.

There's no Gauntlet work in sight and a combination of low boost and slow-ish Activation make her Ship Ability of Hull Repair a tough pill to swallow as well. Even if you're ENG deficient, this is a card best left to collectors or weirdos named Alex.
