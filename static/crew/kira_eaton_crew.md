If the Far Beyond the Stars themed rumors are true, this note may be made obsolete sooner than we’d like, but, frankly, so was Kay Eaton. 

Her debut voyage score wasn’t great to begin with, but shoving out of spacedock wearing the CMD/DIP/SCI skill set is begging for power creep to do its dirty deed unless you’re rocking some major power notes.

Kay’s often been reduced to “the only Kira with SCI” and it’s true, that should be of use going forward. If there was one name who could weather not getting any event help from traits, Kira is probably it. Remarkably consistent with variant events over the years, Kay will be a fine plug-n-play weekend shuttle pilot, even if her events are thick with CMD/DIP/SEC seating.

Settling for events and collections to hang her hat on like many crew much older than her, Kay dropped from daily use faster than a lot of options her age, but should settle into a part time role nicely with at least one or two niches to exploit.
