I'm going to tell you a story.
Just a while ago, during the Hologram mega, I tried a second account at the worst time.
A more motley lineup of event crew you've never seen, from Minuet to Harriman.
Po might actually be better than all of them combined.
Boy, I wish I had her as my starting crew and if you snagged her early, good timing!

From top to bottom, Runaway excels and hits several elite high spots.
A great event/base pairing, thanks to Disco, but even better may be her voyage work.
Po slots in as the top ENG/DIP voyager, one of only three in the top 140.
Family runaway or not, Po is one crew you'll want to welcome with open arms.
