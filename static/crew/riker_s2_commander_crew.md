We’re assuming that the threatening Evil Kirk mood lighting is because Riker knows his day will come. Rather traity for an Uncommon card, he picked up his first stat-boosting collection a few years into WRG’s run on them and has more yet to come. You can certainly find better cadet options and you’ll often be drowning in CMD/DIP/SEC crew, so feel free to keep Riker in your back pocket as a leveling project for the midgame.
