Festive Jadzia all grown up. The #2 CMD crew overall only beaten by Klingon Dukat and the distance in skill isn’t that far between them. Her CMD/SCI stats are reasonable enough to grant her the #7 voyage crew among 3* crews and with her dual female/alien nature she can knock out a fair few nodes in the weekend cadet missions. Should you have a ship with the position ability then 200% damage bonus is not to be knocked alongside a mighty +6 evasion and there’s some potential for use in the Gauntlet too. Dax continues to be one of the most useful crewmembers the game can produce.
