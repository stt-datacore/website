Fairly usable from several angles and excelling in niche situations, Prince Bashir was a giveaway crew late in 2018. If you have a copy (or two) of him from then, he's almost always going to be worth starring up via beholds. While nothing pops off the stat sheet, the secret sauce is a heady mix of triple collections and his skill set. A CMD base 600 (!!) points better than the next variant all but guarantees him faction event work even from 1/5 and on voyages, he's in the top ten for combined MED+CMD. Prince is a step or two below the sort of crew you'll want to spend honor on, but as a behold choice, he's firmly above average.
