Oh man, this guy's got everything. He has, uh, bases...and and he's got...traits. Just about everything you need in a crew. 

In truth, the lack of a third skill doesn't hurt too much for crew who don't voyage or gauntlet anyways, so despite missing a little shuttle flexibility, Elnor (which is Elvish for 'jumped the shark') floats among dozens if not hundreds of low end behold options who will fill an event shuttle with a bonus or tick a few collection boxes.

Shuttle friendly bases even give him a better chance to ride shotgun on the weekend than an equivalent power ENG or MED option and future show bonuses aren't entirely outside the realm of possibility. A longtime punchline among Timelines elitists (hey, that's us!), take solace in knowing that Elnor has his uses, even if he's a card that you're generally forced into taking.
