One of the best super rare voyagers currently in the game and likely for a long time thanks to skill set. Zimmerman is her closest competition, but he lacks the same punch - like all other ENG+MED crew, he sacrifices some base power for versatility. Not so here. Her top 5 SCI base is laudable, and although an equivalent Burnham or Dax might be better to keep around since they pick up a lot of events as well, it's hard to talk about "when you freeze her", because with her voyage credentials, she won't be edged out there until you're super late game 🐋.
