The Mr. Potato Head of Trek characters, many of Data's variants seem to have the same solid core with just some external tweaks from crew to crew. That's not a bad thing; they're all pretty reliable and Mirror is among the best. Data + Mirror events number near 20 and though no variant will give you a big event edge since five Datas rank within 15 ENG spots of each other, it's hard to have too many. Aside from being the only ENG/SEC Data, he's one of five ENG/SEC crew in the top 100 voyagers. Even if you already own a Data, the other behold choices should be spectacular for you to pass on this ultra dependable crew.
