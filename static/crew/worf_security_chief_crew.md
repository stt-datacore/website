While Worf variant sprout up left and right, don't forget this humble cadet stalwart. The Starfleet and alien tags allow Worf to let you unlock most of the "important" cadet nodes on weekdays, as the ladies usually like to stop at the elite level on Thursdays. Combined with several trait nodes that are tailor-made for him, Worf is the premier Uncommon SEC option for new players with a strong, enduring collection spot to boot.
