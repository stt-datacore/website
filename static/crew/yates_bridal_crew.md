Here comes the bride! Although don’t tell the prophets, I hear they never approved the union, this could spell trouble for Bajor! Kasidy joins the long, long line of Super Rare DIP/CMD two skillers that will likely see the inside of the freezer door for the remainder of the game. There is no voyage appeal although she does catch a 25% gauntlet once in a while for younger rosters, just don’t hope to defrost her often unless a Kasidy or Romantic faction event comes along.
