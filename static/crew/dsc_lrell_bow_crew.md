L'Rell boasts the best SEC base at the uncommon level with a DIP secondary that can mop up a few weekday nodes as well. The lack of a Starfleet tag limits her to two days of duty per week, but a valuable kollection spot makes her a must-have for every roster at some point, even if you pass on her to start your Timelines career in favor of a more flexible option or one that has a less Faction item-heavy build.
