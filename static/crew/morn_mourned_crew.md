The Day the Chatter Died. The Loss of the Loquacious Lurian. Quark’s Quandry.

Regardless of the name you remember it by, it’s barely suitable in describing the loss that Deep Space Nine - nay, the Alpha Quadrant - felt that day. He wouldn’t want us to wallow in our sadness, however, so it’s fitting that this wonderful tribute of a character can hop aboard many an Inspiring Antimatter Seat and Voyage off into the sunset. Morn may not have been a saint, as his placement in the Criminal Collection would tell you, but the tales of the Lissepian Mother’s Day Heist will put a smile on your face as you chuckle at the fact it was probably the one story in existence he never told himself. So gather ‘round, take a seat, and raise a glass of Yridian Ale.

Keep it warm. For Morn.
