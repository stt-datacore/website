Another simple tailor who we can curiously take at face value. He's almost a strict downgrade from Obsidian Garak and his only particularly notable attributes are a variant-best (but weak) CMD and a vanity collection spot. His only daily contributions are likely to come as the result of a star advantage. Garak's trait pool is ripe for future mega events, but taking stars on an otherwise poor crew on the back of a hunch is playing Cardassian roulette.
