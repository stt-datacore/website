Janeway is not an event name you need to worry about, even if she's had her ups and downs. Despite Agent's weak bases, she will have ample opportunity for both weekend bonuses and good skill seating, though her traits aren't particularly generous for future event possibilities.

Her power otherwise is a dud and definitely shows the card's age, both on voyages and even in her 45% gauntlets. A big collection plus steady event work is one of the more bankable value combos in the game, so even though you may not use Agent often, there are reasons to behold her.
