I'm experiencing a bit of nIb'poH - we just had this crew last week and his name then was Human Torres. I recommend reading her note and the Sergey and Helena Rozhenko comparison as it's still relevant. In this case, Trip trades in the useful Jury Rigger trait for Casual (not ideal) and his primary, DIP, is continually hammered and the most common "New top X rank!". In most scenarios this is a crew whose bases will make a tangible difference twice a year; just often enough to remind you that he's on your roster. The rest of the time it's advisable to seek investment in crew who offer better power or more utility.
