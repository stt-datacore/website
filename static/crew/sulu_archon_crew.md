Girl, look at that body. Full marks to Sulu for picking up a collection spot, but that DIP base body is as empty calories as it gets. Flipping through the pages of Sulu's event profile, we see an off-the-wall Pilot mega, potentially eating up his most/only eventable trait, and the ugly, stock-standard trait set of Human/Starfleet/Federation which is simply a stat padder.

Sulu's first event feature didn't provide a bonus for variants, his second was supposed to, but was bugged, and his third was his first, latest, and only event value for long-suffering Takei fans over a four year stretch. Thin event potential automatically puts him ahead of several other collection-only choices, but that's as ringing of an endorsement as we can muster.
