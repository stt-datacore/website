A victim of power creep just like Syrran was a victim of desert electrical charges(?) in The Forge, Syrran, who is notedly not a Syrranite, remains an Event/Collection wildcard with a puff of Gauntlet use. A ceiling of six Collections and the Trait events that go with them, plus 25% Crit in almost twenty Gauntlets makes him a safe investment in Beholds or Crew Retrieval.
