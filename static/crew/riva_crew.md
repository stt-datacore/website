RIVA'S CHORUS: Welcome to my note, honored friends.

RIVA'S CHORUS BALANCE: I am an experienced mediator. The toil of shuttles day after day wash against the beachhead of your resolve like an abrading ocean. But I and my chorus manage to squeeze into a single seat through the magic of plot device and will masterfully haul basic holoprograms to and fro for you.

RIVA'S CHORUS SCHOLAR: But I know you've looked my name up on a spreadsheet and the ratings aren't great. My substantial diplomacy base, while perfectly in keeping with a legend of my stature, will find few chances to be of much use with my esoteric trait set and my lack of a third skill means I will never set foot on a voyage. Although, if we're being honest, even the second skill is a stretch. Do I look like a scientist?

RIVA'S CHORUS WARRIOR: Nerds, they tend to ramble, neglect the collections. I am passion, the libido. I am the anarchy of stat boosts, the romantic and the lover. I am also the traits, the perfect lineup which WRG never gets wrong. You will never have another chance to use your Ramatis III Native polestar. Retrieve me now and I will fill your collections with fire and desire. Aaaand dance break!
