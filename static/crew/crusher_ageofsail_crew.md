Crusher's skill set has been carrying her for a long time, but the numbers simply aren't there anymore. Yawn-inducing voyage, base, and event rankings with gauntlet pairs that require hefty amounts of crit to function outside of the early game.

The afforementioned skill set and slim gauntlet work make her something of a boon to newer players, but there's no light at the end of the tunnel; her ceiling has a hard cap of MED/CMD voyages and one-a-year Faction work. If you're taking her, it's either because you have a crush on Gates McFadden (guilty), or because you really want that vanity collection all sewn up.
