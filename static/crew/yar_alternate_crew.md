A somewhat surprising event count considering her time on screen gives Yar the occasional chance to showcase her sturdy SEC base on weekends. Outside of that, a 300% instant damage ability with great offensive passive stats may earn her a spot for the Captain division of arena or Skirmishes for newer players, even at 1/4, but you should be searching for faster options not long after.
