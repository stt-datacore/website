## DataCore v3.2

DataCore is a companion resource to Tilting Point's [Star Trek Timelines](https://www.tiltingpoint.com/games/star-trek-timelines/) game. It's designed as a compendium of data, statistics and assets, both extracted from the game as well as user generated.

The website pages are assembled using the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) static site generator, from source material in the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/stt-datacore/).

> The game already has a wiki! Why does this project exist?

The wiki is entirely user-generated, which means it is susceptible to human error. This website is a "structured CMS"; some of the data is fully structured and exported from the game (meaning it's trusted to be complete and accurate), while other data (such as help pages, BigBook entries, etc.) are edited and contributed by users. This structure allows easy, partially automated updates, and opens the door for more consumption scenarios (style the data into any format we want, such as spreadsheets, documents, Discord bot-consumable endpoints, etc.)
