Vosk (esq) spawned as a strong voyage/base daily use type of super rare, but after a couple years of tap dancing on the big stage, he can't rely on his looks to get by anymore. If you have all four stars, he's still a usable voyager on a young roster for a while longer ('Just retrieve Braxton!'), but there isn't much meat on the bone otherwise.

A handful of traits whose pools are mostly huge or tiny likely disqualify him from ever becoming a collection must-have and the same holds true for events. Until, say, the Villain mega/collection, Vosk can remain untouched on the behold screen or in your cryostasis.
