Raffi is what we refer to as “empty calories”. There’s a big base, sure, but it’s not obnoxiously large like Captain Tribble or bolstered by frequent events like First Officer Burnham. In fact Raffi’s trait list is light enough to be labeled a disappointment in most areas, having provided zero event bonuses as of this writing and only marginal collection value. Pass on this crew if she’s not flanked by Cartwright and D’Nesh.
