We'd all love to snag his double collections and massive event count, but lowish base and voyage numbers are not the payoff you'd expect for a torturous build which includes 64 2* IDICs and 150+ faction items overall. Even if/when he reaches a third event feature, small bonus legendary crew may come close to his effectiveness.
