The Combs Clone does snag one day of cadet work per week, but he’s more of a “late early game” leveling project as you look to sweep up locked nodes on the galaxy map. His traits work wonderfully for that, including the tricky Dominion DIP node in episode eight, and also for his collection count, which should continue to grow over time.
