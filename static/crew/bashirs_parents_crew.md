There's a joke that makes the rounds referring to The Bashirs' riding shotgun on the first recorded 'natural' twelve hour Voyage, but they're not a crew you should be targeting for that part of the game, especially not from star one. They're more or less just a low-level Collection piece with a place in Timelines' history (congratulations Roykirk).
