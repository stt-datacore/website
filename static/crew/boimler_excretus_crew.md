It's absolutely incredible that this early much anticipated card is as ineffective as he is. Let's start with the Rarity, where he makes you question WRG’s priorities. While Excreto does have a leg up over other variant Super Rares in that you can actually use him for Voyages on a really young roster, he’s by no means a dupe candidate. If you're particularly unlucky having time/resources to progress through the event rewards to earn any copies, the Community Rewards will at least give you one.

His wheelhouse remains the fact that, as a Super Rare, you won’t feel bad freezing and forgetting. An ENG base that only stands out as variant-best will likely do little, if any, lifting for you when he gets the call for Event work. His arena ability has little to offer, being outstripped in all of its important aspects by other Super Rares.

The elephant in the room is clearly the hopes we as players built up while waiting for this already iconic moment to drop. We waited patiently while non-Legendary after non-Legendary dropped, hopping that this would be the one to break the streak. After He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named took that honour, we still held out for more. Though not at USS Titan Bradward Boimler levels of disgusting, his stats could be mistaken for a return to the joke(?) of Boimler variants being poop-pee. His opportunities for use outside of fun Bridge lineups are minimal, but hey at least he’s the second best “of Borg” in the game!
