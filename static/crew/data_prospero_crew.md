Prospero, a 2017 crew, is certainly starting to look his age. Having missed out on the Holodeck Enthusiasts collection to his big brother Data V, Prospero has also seen his previously rare skill set expand and his voyage power continue to drop. Now relegated primarily to event crew, he cobbles together a handful of vaguely eventable traits to combo with the Data name which is thought of as "solid", but has seen its event chances decrease each calendar year.
