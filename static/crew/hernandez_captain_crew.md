Here she finally is - the first female Captain in Starfleet, the vaunted commander of the NX-02 Columbia, who climbs mountains in her spare time, and who can even deal with noted bonehead Captain Archer at his most introspective. What has the game got for us? Is she a Gauntlet powerhouse? A trait bonanza, a voyage monster? A new #1 base, perhaps?

Hernandez’s card is a deserved punchline and one of the first names that come to mind when someone wants an example of an awful crew. Yea, a CMD base will play for Romantic or Athlete events and they should both join Resourceful as collections before too long, but even her best case scenario ends up as a below average card. If you want Captain Erika for non-gameplay reasons, take solace in the estimation that she’ll be a triple collection threat some day, but it probably won’t be on my roster.
