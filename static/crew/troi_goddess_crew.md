I am the goddess of Empathy. Cast off your voyages and embrace traits, events, gauntlet.

Troi's miniscule second proficiency (and lack of a third) will scare most players off of her in the gauntlet and rightfully so, most of the time. But MED/DIP is not a Wall of Doom skill pairing like DIP/SCI or ENG/SCI tends to be and her unique trait lineup afford her plenty of big crit gauntlets, which should be a big point in her favor for young rosters, if nothing else.

Troi events have been feast or famine from year to year, so it's been nice to see traits to the rescue again as they spackle over some otherwise glaring holes in her event history. Already a multi-collection piece with room for advancement in that area, GoE Troi has already achieved the balance of harmony in the event/collection purgatory where many older crew float and wait for their traits to provide value.
