There are two types of rosters mulling Lissan in beholds; those just starting out in the game and taking her so-so gauntlet ability to help them out of a bad behold or late game players eyeing her traits to get them out of a bad behold. In either case, you shouldn’t be considering her if there are any respectable options flanking her.

Two near identical proficiencies give her a nice on-paper CMD/DIP roll, but there are a few flies in her soup. Gauntlet exclusive Balok will form a Demilitarized Zone of walls for years to come and Lissan lacks a beefy single roll to pick up any lucky 1-for-2 rolls against weaker competition. If her specific skill pair doesn’t pop up, you’re out of luck.

At least most of her collection value comes front loaded. We could see that count creep upwards with Telepath, Civilian, or even Aenar if Strange New Worlds does gangbusters business (just kidding) and so she’s an acceptable consolation prize if your behold offers you a few lumps of coal.
