The game’s 1,000th crew is plainly a disappointment that we’re not even going to try to dress up. Voyages are the only area where there’s day one usability, but not until all five stars are acquired - stars best spent on more long term or broadly usable options. Whatever Ben Sisko saw in Jen, we’re not seeing it.
