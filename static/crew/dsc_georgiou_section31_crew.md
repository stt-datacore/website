Colonel Wai Lin's voyage score remains stout even years after her debut, but a re-tread skill set and severe lack of anti-matter traits will see her crowded out of that area before too long. Luckily, she's everyone's favorite Empress (sorry Hoshi), bringing a triggerless 200% instant damage ship ability and juicy shuttle metrics to the table.

An up and down event history includes a bonus tally inflated by a rash of Discovery megas, but Yeoh seems firmly entrenched in Trek at this point and her traits have provided as many event bonuses as we could ask for from a pool that size. With early game usage and a perpetually thawable SEC base, Georgiou is a card worth taking home to meet your mother...just make sure you're cooking ganglia that night.
