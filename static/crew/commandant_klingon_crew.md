Even as instant damage options grow in the arena, RPC remains an elite name. The double dipping of big boom plus top end +10 attack boost makes him a great package who will cut down Skirmish times and arena opponents alike. 

If you're already stocked with premier shipboard options, the Commandant is still fine crew. Despite owning a skill set you're already overrun with, he also supplies satisfactory voyage numbers with some juicy antimatter traits and a 1200+ CMD base will sit near the top of most of his trait lists. Double collections headlined by the expansive Klingon trait are a real possibility if you decide to add stars for his hefty attack ability.
