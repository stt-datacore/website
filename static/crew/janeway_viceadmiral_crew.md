Even in the distant alternate future, Kathryn Janeway will find a way to slot herself into weekend Events and this Vice Admiral variant is no different. Once a monster Voyager, VAJ’s remaining value is in her Trait list and the aforementioned variant Events, which are as frequent as her coffee cup refills. Four collections by now and up to two more to round out a solid six, you may also want to invest in a copy for Fleet Boss Battles Node solving while you round out her final stars.
