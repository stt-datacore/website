One of the gatekeepers of the Primal Collection, she’s among the best of that bad set of Crew you have to Immortalize to fully unlock its potential. Three non-Vanity Collections out of a quartet of Traits seems like a good hit rate, and with a little more love to her show recently, you might see her catch a Mega Event’s worth of bonuses before long. A “eh, she’s not bad” choice in Legendary Beholds is really her ceiling.
