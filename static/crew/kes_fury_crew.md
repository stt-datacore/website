As it turns out, you WOULD like her when she’s angry. If you’re a Kes fan, enjoy this long-requested version, because unless/until WRG releases Sweaty Puberty Kes, this is likely to be her last strong option for a long time to come. Luckily, she plans to go out with a bang, starting with a Captain Killy copy/paste Ship Ability which will always be worth its weight in Skirmish/Arena gold, no matter who it’s attached to.

Unfortunately despite a desirable Skill set, power creep has worked its magic on her and applied old age makeup to not only Jennifer Lien but also this card’s daily use prospects. Fury can still find herself plenty of use on your Gauntlet team of five with strong Proficiencies to go along with four handfuls of 25% Crit and a trio of 45% sets. 

Her inclusion in a very niche Botanist Collection and a few other eclectic and possible unviable Traits will likely top her out at a trio of bonuses, but you never know; the sky’s the limit with the Collection Era of STT.
