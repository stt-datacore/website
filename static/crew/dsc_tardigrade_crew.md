Ripper's value is highly volatile and is event and roster dependent. Until the all-Disco megas cease, Ripper holds exceptional value. A 2x event bonus coupled with its huge base would put it on par with featured event crew in many cases. But if that sort of blanket bonus is all in the past then you have a crew who, while great for daily shuttles even at 1/5, may struggle for weekend consistency if you have a healthy number of super rares to thaw for events.

I'm not enamored with non-event bases, but Ripper's SEC is within thirty points of #1 Sisko and so will perform similarly for faction events in non-bonus situations. Flying under the radar is an uncommon skill pair that doesn't mesh well for shuttles, but can find voyage work on the right roster. We're never looking for reasons to run 2-skillers in that section of the game, but only the vaunted Gary Seven provides a better SEC+SCI sum among 3-skill crew.
