She's no (Riker's) Angel, but she's pretty close! Having the Starfleet trait and the female "shadow trait" means she can perform on Cadet Challenges 4 weekdays out of 5. And perform she does, possessing the hands-down #1 CMD score among Uncommon cards.

As if that wasn't enough, she also provides lasting value with membership in the Mirror Universe collection, bumping Smiley O'Brien for "easiest-to-Immortalize" honors in that collection. Consider her Tier 2 with a bullet ... or a dagger, phaser, or whatever other weapon Her Admiralship prefers to wield.
