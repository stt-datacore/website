Suder doesn’t belong on any active rosters and if you’re looking for a reason to snag a great on-screen character, you’ll be looking to the Circle of Traits which seeks to bring all crew to relevance sooner or later. Although Brutal is the only one which has triggered a bonus to date, the Wheel of Megas is a fickle mistress and if he does end up snagging a month’s reprieve from cryo, Suder’s two borderline usable-when-bonus bases should be fine for at least requisition shuttles, thanks to some shallow pools of crew who share his traits.
