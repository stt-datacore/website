I'm not sure what Kyle enthusiasts were expecting from his debut crew, but this might even be better than that. Granted, he's a total event dud and may remain that way for good barring some stray communicator events. But he does debut with worthwhile voyage ability and a huge collection that will need him until the end of the game while Communicator waits in the wings for its chance to shine. To my fellow Kyleians; hold fast, brothers. Surely silver fox Wrath of Khan Kyle is coming!
