President Doc, someone we all wish was on the ballot the last several years, had been getting comfy in the role of new player crew. But with his voyage work a thing of the past in most cases, he's begun his transition to mouthwatering collection smörgåsbord to appeal to more established rosters, not that new players can't benefit from them as well.

Still viable are Doc's impressive elevated crit sets, including a 65%er. Without many DIP/MED walls out there, he'll help you get your foot in the door in a competitive area of the game while you look to transition to legendary options.
