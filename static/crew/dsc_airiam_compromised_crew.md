An arena quote like "Open the Airlock" is just begging to be riffed on, but Airiam does have a few perks up the sleeves of her Power Rangers outfit.

A beefy trait list, including the hidden 'evsuit', has paid dividends here and there in the form of collections and event bonuses. While the latter is dampened by an uncommon skill pair on shuttles and the presumptive end of Discovery events, a single 1500+ SEC base is plenty to fill shuttle seats any other time she snags a bonus.

If you're a new player facing her in a particularly nasty begold, Airiam has roughly two dozen elevated crit gauntlets and just barely enough proficiency power to make a few gauntlets for you in your first couple of months of play.
