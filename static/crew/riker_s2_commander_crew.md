Formally the #1 2* Diplomat before L’Rell came along. He’s a slightly better Commander Chakotay with a decent ship ability. His SEC isn’t much to brag about and he doesn’t have much use in cadet missions but a handy crewmember for the early game. Don’t be afraid to move him on if he’s outstayed his welcome, handy advice from Deanna...
