What's she awaiting, you ask? For Spock to put away his...Spock...and help his father out of a life-threatening situation? For her next wardrobe change? For better alliteration, perhaps? The answer, dear reader, is all of the above. The voyage score may not pop quite as brightly as her boa, but that’s her best shot at daily use for your roster.

About as useful as it gets for a DIP-led voyage skill set, Amanda’s strong anti-matter chances and useful MED/CMD stack should keep her in contention for niche voyage spots long after many other crew. When those opportunities end, however, her life as one of a thousand event/collection combos probably won’t be illustrious thanks to a very feast-or-famine event history and fairly populated traits pools.
