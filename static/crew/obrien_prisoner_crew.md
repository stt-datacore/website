Good voyage numbers, including the #2 voyage ENG, will earn him work there alongside low fusion 5* crew. The tough Jury Rigger collection and a half dozen Oâ€™Brien events grant him long term benefits as well. Though his proficiency total isn't spectacular, he owns the #2 ENG roll (#7 overall) in a fairly competitive skill outside of The Caretaker.
