The Smoke and Mirrors collection came along at the right time to prop up the value of a one-off crew who seems to have lost the comforting relevance of blanket Discovery bonuses of yore. With ranks drooping in all corners and a big tumble in event chances, Shukar has one other area of note besides his dual collections; gauntlet. Two 45% crit sets will bump him above the walls of Locutuses for 48 hours at a time and makes him a fine rotational piece in that section of the game.
