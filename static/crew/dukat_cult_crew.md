Pah-wraith jokes aside, where we feel the love is Dukat's trait potential. A theoretical seven collection ceiling would be monumental value that would have Dukat demanding that, well...you build a monument to him on Cardassia. 

His only other area of contribution is event shuttles. While he'll likely never reach that spirited 2018 level of variant event love, his traits have actually underperformed for bonuses and should be in line for several megas down the line.
