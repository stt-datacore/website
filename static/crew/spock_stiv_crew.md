Like most crew with three skills he is fairly middle of the road (still recovering from all that LDS he took in the 60s?). Some useful traits place him in 3 stat-boosting Collections (including the difficult to complete Musician one) and will help you out in two Cadet Missions. Good for early game voyages but don’t expect him to crit many missions nodes outside of his trait bonus.
