Nomad coordinate! Oops, wrong episode. Well, equally iconic to the Original Series faithful is the suppository-looking Nomad. This probe's Ã¼ber sophisticated tech doesn't quite translate in game, leaving him on the outside looking in for daily use. 

An interesting cocktail of traits should lengthen Nomad's voyage lifespan just a hair and, if you cross your fingers hard enough, offer up some event chances down the line. With WRG's collection push in full bloom and a few collections in hand already, Nomad is in line to serve man for at least a while longer.
