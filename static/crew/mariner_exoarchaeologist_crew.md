She may no longer be Starfleet, but she’s still a filthy hew-mon. And definitely not NOT channeling her inner Indiana Jones.

Exo-Mariner vine jumps her way across deep chasms and into Timelines with an almost certifiable BigBase™ (who knows when the next SCI beast comes along to knock her down a peg), but it’s actually her top Skill Pairing where she really shines. If you’ve got a SCI/ENG shuttle (and let’s face it, you probably don’t…ENG continues to be underrepresented here), Beckett’s your gal! With no sign that LD is anywhere close to done, she should get plenty of use on your Event shuttles with that Primary Skill alone, even if she doesn’t slip into daily use.

These beefy Base Skills are also backed up with some Proficiencies that, while not Gauntlet worthy, do provide some niche Voyage use. Though outshined overall in her Pairing/Triplet, her Explorer and Maverick traits will make her quite useful when they show up as Antimatter Seat Bonuses. These same two traits could potentially one day get Collections of their own, but for now she’s merely going to help you out on Two Stat-Boosting ones. Rounding out her use is a respectable +15000 Crit Bonus Ship Ability that can tide you over until such time as you’ve unlocked Demo Man Scotty from your Fleet Boss Battle Captain’s Bridge.

In short, Mariner is a nice-to-have, not a must-have, especially if you enjoy her character and/or show. So grab yourself a frosty Rom-Ale and don’t feel bad about getting a copy if you have the chance, but don’t feel like you need to route through the Bitrus Expanse in order to get her.
