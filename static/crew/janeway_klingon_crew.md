Janeway’s going to have to pull a Worf soon - “I have nothing…but my honor” - as she loses daily use footholds over time. It’s hard to believe that her voyage power used to play thanks to an underrepresented SEC/SCI stack, but those days are behind her. And while she filled an Ardra-lite role in arena if you wanted to thaw the prototype, a flat 10,000 crit bonus isn’t quite as punchy as other options.

There’s still value in easy SEC seating for an event-heavy character and she has enough traits to keep her afloat there and in the collections tab. All things considered, she remains above average value for a crew from 2017, but will need to pick her spots to make a splash these days.
