Falling out of voyage contention, Nog might find some early game work if fused for other reasons, but is easily dismissed by a single legendary star in most cases. To compensate, a post-release value perk in the immense Costume Party collection is now often the primary reason to behold Nog.

As for events and the chance to utilize Nog's strong ENG base - the optimist would say that we haven't had a Ferengi mega yet, the pessimist would say that he's only had one bonus in nearly three years. So...is the vault half empty or half full?
