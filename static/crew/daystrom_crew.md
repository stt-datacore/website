You know, I knew good ol' Dick Daystrom back in college. Guy was a whizz with numbers. Pulled a lot of tail, too. All-American halfback for the SpacePatriots...shifty sonuvabitch used to juke those android defenders right outta their moon boots. We rode him all the way to the State finals. Sorry...where was I?

The venerable creator of the M-5 computer and namesake for both the Daystrom Institute and Award has a much longer list of accomplishments in-universe than he does in-game, so at least he won’t be losing any sleep at night.

His first star will net you a decent ENG/SCI bench warmer with a couple of respectable 45% crits should you not yet have the mightier Exclusive options yet. Young (or just unlucky) rosters can take advantage of Tricky Dick until such time as RNG blesses them.

After this point though, it’s a long and painful wait to get to a fully Immortalized five stars, but when you do finally get there you’ll be rewarded with a notch in four Stat-Boosting Collections, to take the sting off of a card bound for the freezer upon completion.
