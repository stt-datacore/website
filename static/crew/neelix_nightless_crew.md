My therapist said that I should talk about my fears – and that that would help me conquer them. Probably my greatest fear is nihiliphobia, or the fear of nothingness. My therapist was asking me what’s wrong, and I would respond with ‘nothing”.

I wonder why he kicked me out?

Anyway, here’s Neelix! And he suffers from the same dreadful fear, but maybe The Doctor can help him replicate some curtains. In the meantime, Neeliix will find his way into your crew quarters, should you choose to play a Galaxy event where you can get four copies with trivial effort.

Panic Attack Neelix is a strong Voyager from Voyager (ha!) among the Super-Rare crew varieties, almost at the top of his DIP/SCI/SEC class. However, his lack of bonus Trait matches (only three at launch) and lack of Gauntlet or Shuttle use will mean that only newer players will find use out of our favorite Talaxian. What’s scarier is that Neelix only dreams of Collections, as he launches with one.

The ending to this bedtime story? Freeze Mr. Nightmare and let him enjoy a peaceful rest.
