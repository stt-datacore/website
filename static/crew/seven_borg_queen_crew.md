Context is for kings. If this were various points along 2018 or 2019, Seven would be a skippable event crew. In 2021 where she debuts, Seven may end the year as a top five overall crew release. And as an honor hall offering whose price is far above the average...well, that's really up to you to decide.

Forecasting voyage futures can take a little finesse now that collection bonuses shift ranks and scores on a monthly basis - Seven debuts about twenty-five ranks higher than her bonus-neutral score, for example. And although she's one of a handful of CMD/ENG crew who elicit cries of "Just retrieve Braxton instead", she's more than competent as a day one voyager and looks to split the long term ROI difference between Lord Braxton and a lot of saggy-ranked crew released around her.

Collections, increasingly a consideration these days, are a nice safety blanket for an always-there honor hall crew, despite the high cost to acquire. And nearby doubling the base power of other available Seven CMD options, the Queen should provide long term value in the realm of shuttles and events as well. Seven's variant event history isn't as impressive as some, but she'll look to bring home a couple of features yearly with traits further supplementing her bonus chances overall.

Typically we'd like to see from honor hall crew an enduring attribute like big gauntlet power or lynchpin potential like Captain Killy's arena ability. While Seven doesn't necessarily provide anything that you won't see offered most weeks elsewhere, she's well-rounded and with enough debut power in several areas to be a strong card on her own merits. Plucking her from the honor hall is a competitive option with pros and cons, though it might be advisable to invest in cheaper, comparable alternatives from events and crew retrieval first if possible.
