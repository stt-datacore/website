Her big, fat gauntlet MED roll is Crusherâ€™s most noteworthy attribute. A couple of ranked gauntlet pairs among all crew establishes her baseline power and can be absolutely deadly when she hits 65% crit. Having probably peaked in the collection tab as well, Doc comes with front-loaded value there and is a fine snag for late game players too. Crusher is never likely to blossom into an event player, especially with repugnant bases, but if gauntlet luck be a lady, her name is Doc Crusher.
