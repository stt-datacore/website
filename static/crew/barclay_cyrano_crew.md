The arguments to be had about the exclusion of this Barclay from Holodeck Enthusiasts while recovering addict Commander Barclay gets in is a conversation for the ages - long after you've fully equipped, levelled and frozen this beloved/unloved card. Middle of the pack bases and sub-par voyage power mean that poor Cyrano is limited to squeezing in on the action on the odd Barclay event, or perhaps as an early-activating evasion option who might run out of gas while your ship is still being pounded.

Beyond thin chances for 'real' use lies a pair of collections. One massive and promising value to Pinocchio for years to come, the other that won't miss Barclay's presence (go figure), but which may turn into a lucrative 1-2 collection punch should it be expanded.
