If statistical minutia like #3 Torres DIP excites you, then Liaison Torres is the crew for you! More of a statistical punchline than even an early game contender, the vast majority of this card's value comes in the generous appending of the Diplomat and the even larger Klingon collections.

Outside of collecting skill boosts, she might be worth thawing for the odd Torres event if you have a surplus of merits, slots, and time, but only due to a lack of variant DIP options. Even with bonuses, these bases are pretty pathetic, and she'll leave you wondering why you bothered to thaw her when you shove her back into the freezer.
