Without the emotional attachment of a main cast character or an eye-popping Voyage number, it's understandable that this former 6-packer was passed over by many, but Commander Exodia bn Bem is almost as fun to use as he is to say.

It's the Gauntlet where Mr. Bemjamin will make hay. His upper echelon Proficiency total, top five SCI roll, and trio of ranked Gauntlet pairs are all assets that you're likely to find very useful. When WRG rolled out the red carpet for Balok, bn Bem also caught his first 45% Gauntlet to go with fistfuls of elevated Crit Gauntlets.

Those Traits also grant him multi-Collection status with room for that count to grow. While his Skill set would make him a mouth-watering Voyager if he had the requisite power, it's still a boon for bn Bem in the Gauntlet and makes him a powerful and versatile choice from star one.
