An interesting crew from a hilarious episode. Disappointing voyage numbers, but as with other uncommon skill sets it matters less as only a half dozen crew with a better stat total have ENG and CMD as their top two skills. That under-represented skill set carries over to the gauntlet where his ENG/CMD pair can compete with the big boys and sits at #4 among all crew. A stat boosting collection and Neelix + Ferengi events round him out nicely.
