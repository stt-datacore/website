Even though the first inclination is to slot Mirror Doctor Culber immediately into tier 1 simply due to his stylish red leather Mirror Starfleet uniform, we are going to refrain (for now). Mirror Hugh enters Star Trek Timelines brandishing a phaser in an aggressive posture and also wields akimbo 1k bases of SEC and MED. While dual 1k bases may seem blase to the veteran Captain, the skills in which he has them are rarely paired up, evoking visions of stellar crew like Tactical Officer Neelix and Warship EMA. He doesn’t enter the game as a top 100 voyager, but he isn’t far off, and his skill combination buoys his longevity on voyages.

Unless your gauntlet roster is anemic you won't likely bring Mirror Culber to play, due to a middling SEC roll and lackluster secondary and tertiary rolls, but he may find a place on a newer captain’s gauntlet squad. His ship ability which features an Accuracy handicap will not likely endear him to Skirmish and Arena use.

We assume that Discovery mega events are kaput and yet can picture future variant events with Star Trek: Discovery just having wrapped up airing season 3 and Culber being main cast. Having seen a recent Mirror Universe mega event (second) and with WRG’s propensity to repeat trait megas (Mirror, Scoundrel, Vulcan), we could see more of the same.

He adds +1 to an increasingly easy Physician collection, but more importantly is a top tier Mirror Universe collection crew.  His inclusion represents one less Fungal Entity May or Mirror Detmer you need to fuse up to complete the collection and God knows you’d rather not cite those garbage Mirror golds or take them in begolds unless you can help it. I would gladly subject myself to Mirror Doctor Culber’s tender care and fuse him up quickly.
