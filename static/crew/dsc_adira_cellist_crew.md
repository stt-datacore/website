Adira followed Culber's lead to ring in their Timelines career, boasting three worthwhile, available legendary variants in a short span. Naturally, a cooldown period was due - enter Cellist Adira.

There's nothing concrete here for veteran players, particularly after the Discovery mega era, though a few off-center traits are in the right range for event or collection bumps down the line. Merely serviceable in most areas, Cellist is a crew that would have benefited from being a Galaxy event reward as a building block for young rosters. As it stands, enjoy the art and wait for their trait lineup to warrant them another look in the future.
