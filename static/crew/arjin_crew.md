His arena quote is another (Cardassian) lie - you're really not looking at much beyond a handful of traits from Arjin. His voyage numbers are edge case usable if you're able to grab all four stars at once early on, but it isn't an attribute to chase one star at a time from beholds. His collection and event tally should increment upwards over time, just don't feel rushed to acquire (or hold) this card until those traits deliver more tangible value.
