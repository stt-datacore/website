Mired in depressing numbers everywhere you look, Kukulkan is a crew you get because he's a freaking dragon whose art is fun.

That dab of ENG tacked onto his skill set frankly doesn't move the needle at K's power level. On voyages he debuts *fiftieth* in his primary voyage pair and ENG seating, well, sits near the bottom of appearances in faction events. WRG's mercy will need to grant bonuses to K's Cultural Figure, Inspiring, or Artist traits for the average roster to ever see him make an appearance on their shuttles.

In the "what if?" chapter, fortune seeds a trio of 45% gauntlets into Kukulkan's portfolio which will never bloom, thanks to dire proficiencies. At least a few of us will be able to sell that Serpent polestar for 40,000 ISM in a few years.
