There is a reason that for some time now we have been calling it the DISHonor Hall, but that may all have to change with the inclusion and release of Jack Crusher himself, Borgified into “Vox”! As a side note, it’s hard to understand why the Borg have such a hard-on for Latin.

Let’s not waste time talking about his Traits or Voyage power first; we are going to jump right into the answer to the question “Why should you buy Vox from the Honor Hall at the cost of 2.5 Honor Sale Legendary Beholds + Citation?” 

The answer is… his Ship Ability for Fleet Boss Battles! Jackie Boy is a direct upgrade from Demo Man Scotty (the second in short order with T’Pring as Spock), with faster cycling +16000 Crit Bonus and +10 Attack, giving him a 63% Uptime versus Demo Man’s measly 45%. This translates into millions more damage against the Doomsday Machine, which translates into more Honor and Merits and rewards… you get the picture! 

I did say we were going to talk Traits and Voyages, and they’re not bad either! He’s among the top power options in his Skill set and order, plus a sextet of Antimatter seats for him to catch rides on. Two Collections on debut and two more Traits in waiting make him a decent Collection crew, but really… get him for Fleet Boss Battles and thank us later.
