It's his character! He's the Tash Man. He comes out, he throws trash all over your roster and then he starts eating garbage.

This Voyager one-off has earned his crimson scorecard and the Trash Man moniker (he's not the guy who puffs up his nose in 'Counterpoint', that's Torat) and at this point only his traits can save him. Collections are the only fruit on the Hehold vine, so Tash may lose out to a lot of other options (including a crew slot) until his value in that area grows.
