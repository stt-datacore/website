There’s a term that WRG wants you to know very well; DIPlercation. It’s when they can’t stop printing DIP crew and they multiply exponentially, not out of embarrassment - in fact WRG seems to have no shame.

Doopler is the fifth DIP primary CMD secondary recurring mega crew out of the last seven. First of all, that’s absolutely pathetic. Secondly, it means that despite his impressive debut stats, a player who’s been keeping current with the game may not be upgrading all that much by tacking on his perfunctory final star.

That said, on his own merits he’s a worthwhile crew for raw, day to day usage. Every roster would see him flying shuttles and voyages for the foreseeable future, just keep in mind the short shelf life of DIP base ranks and a skill set which has *averaged* about three top five voyagers per year. If you miss this bus, another will be along at the quarter hour. All hail the treadmill!
