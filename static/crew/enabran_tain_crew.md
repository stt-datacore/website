"A man shouldn't allow his enemies to outlive him." - Tain may have one foot in the grave, but strikes back at his gauntlet enemies with a trio of 45% crit trait sets which all feature skills that he owns. His low ranked pairs aren't quite the same as having Kahless himself on your squad, but Tain will do well as a rotational piece and is a retrievable option if you eschew the Klingon’s price tag or aren’t lucky enough to have snagged Balok yet..

Nothing resembling a good fusion investment, Tain may luck into some requisition work for likely Cardassian events down the line if you're forced (at SEC point) to star him up. His chances there and in the collection tab are both below average.
