"I am Vindicta, vengeance personified! At last, [Ship Battle Opponent], I will bathe in your blood."

Like a rat to the bait, we here at the BigBook are as predictable as always: Seem almost too good to be true, and we’ll drool over you the second your stats drop. Perhaps a tad slow on initialization for her first shot (she does love a good monologue), Vindicta brings to the battlefield an almost unheard of limit-and-trigger-free 400% Instant Damage ability whose cycle time will make your enemies tremble. Fantastic art from a fantastic movie/hologram story/cry for help is the icing on the cake for a crew that’s in 3 stat-boosting collections (4 total), with traits that will earn Super Rare Voyage seats for days. Migleemo can stuff it: this Mariner is the only in-game therapy I need.
