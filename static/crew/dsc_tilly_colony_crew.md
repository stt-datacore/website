Three years of waiting for Tilly's first super rare variant has borne rotten fruit. No perks in the way of collections, arena, or gauntlet and the base/voyage power numbers belong to a 2017 crew.

Her pair of eventable traits, Explorer and Undercover Operative, will both need to hit to keep afloat a character in Tilly who has only averaged one event per year outside of the protective covering of Discovery megas and the upper limit to her collection value is readily apparent.
