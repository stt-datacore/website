ðŸŽµTell me Ghemor, Tell me Ghemor...was it love at first sight?!
Tell me Ghemor, Tell me Ghemor, did she put up a fightâ€¦at accepting this one-time enemy into her life as a father figure?ðŸŽµ

Doesnâ€™t exactly roll off the tongue, does it? But then, it took a lot of internal struggle for Kira to see Tekeny for the changed man he truly was. A complicated character with a complicated past, this Cardassian Dissident leader simply wanted nothing Ghemor than to be with his daughter, be she biological or kidnapped.

What isnâ€™t complicated is his Skill Set: this take on CMD/DIP/SUCK swaps Security and Diplomacy but otherwise keeps the trend of this overcrowded triplet alive and well. That being said, if youâ€™re gonna do something, do it well, and heâ€™s Ghemor or less one of the best crew you can aim for in this case!

No matter how you break it down, heâ€™s one of the top Voyagers in this triplet with AM Seating options for days (and next to no competition in them)! Heâ€™ll see plenty of use on any roster, and this trait uniqueness will keep him viable for years. Those same traits bring with them 4 Stat-Boosting Collections and a chance at up to 4 Ghemor, making this ÃœberKampaign crew a better investment than most if thatâ€™s your thing, or a great crew to target when he finally enters the Portal. His CMD base will likely stop being considered impressive in the recent future, but Event work is not out of the question given the meaty trait list. The only real dings on this otherwise stellar crew is that Gauntlet usage will be non-existent for most players, and sadly while at first glance his 400% Instant Damage Ship Ability may stand out, with a 12s Initialization time and a Cloak Trigger, heâ€™s dead in the water as far as Ship Battles go. But letâ€™s not focus on the negatives. The content train runneth full speed with great crew after great crew, and we say the Ghemor, the merrier!
