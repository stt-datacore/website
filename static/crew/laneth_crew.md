You weren't the only one who had to look up this crew on Memory Alpha, so let's start out with an easy crew comp to the equally impure Klingon Neelix. They have matching SEC scores and rely on a smattering of traits for thawpertunities, but Laneth's 'saboteur' and 'villain' both seem particularly juicy, while her smooth forehead fortuitously sneaks her into the Engineered collection.

Speaking of, her trio of collections is delightful value for someone you may have never heard of. Laneth wonâ€™t sniff daily work in the vast majority of situations, but has a realistic shot to hit her value ceiling and is worth thawing a few times per year.
