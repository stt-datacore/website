ðŸŽµDancing Queen...young and green...such a libertine.ðŸŽµ That's not a hue of envy, it's nausea. To cut to the chase, this crew absolutely sucks. Her selling points are the Green Girls' ensemble and some superfluous shuttle ranking for the...Orion mega? She's only had as many event bonuses as she has legs, which is surprisingly not two. The trait mega era will give some duds brief periods of relevance (usually only for six days), but beyond that she should really only be rostered for the sweet bridge crew pictures you share with friends.
