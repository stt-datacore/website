You can find something nice to say about every card in the game. Almost every card. Not a single stray event, no middling gauntlet pair, no shot at voyage work here. In fact, the Bynar pair sits outside the top ten super rare voyagers which is something that among legendary crew only one-skill Captain Scott can claim. The only remotely usable attribute this card has is +9 arena EV at six seconds (short duration). Fusing cards to create a legendary has long been requested and is a neat concept, but whether or not you think mashing up all those poor super rares to produce a legendary is worth it, in this case it is not. This is the worst legendary crew in the game.
