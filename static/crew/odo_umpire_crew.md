A 2017 2-skiller - most players should know right off the bat what to expect from that. A fine pinch hitter on shuttles, Odo's plate is rarely crowded, but owns a modest event tally and might even catch a curveball in the form of a constable one-off event.

Already with two leadoff collections, Odo could improve that count and sit juuuuust a bit outside the kind of tempting choices that save you from an ugly behold. It's easy to balk at an older 2-skill crew, but Ump offers enough to avoid a total strike out.
