The Great Material Continuum giveth and taketh away. 2018 was great to Quark, giving him six events in the calendar year, but since then his name has only been called once. Will he get a little love down the line in a Gambler, Ferengi, or Merchant mega? Sure. But until then, he's merely a poor-for-legendary, good-for-super-rare type of shuttle pilot. Although Quark doesn't own a top 15 gauntlet pair, he shows up with 65% crit on occasion which can make even average gauntleteers relevant.
