The only super rare Jury Rigger from the latest (big) portal update is reason enough to take her. Though thereâ€™s light at the end of the tunnel with respect to her collection no longer requiring legendary crew to complete, most rosters still need all the help they can get for it and Ms. Yates can at least do that, if nothing else. With fairly uneventable traits and no number that pops, Yates is a freeze and forget type, unless you stumble into several copies early on in your Timelines journey.
