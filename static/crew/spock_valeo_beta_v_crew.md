Spocktober is here, and WRG wants you to celebrate in the only way they know how – more Spock! And what better way to kick off the Spooky/Spocky season, than with a great theme of a great episode of a great series with strong emotional and logical themes? Oh and death, but that comes later...

Sure, he’s a *good* Voyager, debuting in the top 65 and having an incredible *nine* AM Trait matches, but he’s in a crowded SCI/SUCK/CMD Triplet that has seen a lot of heavy hitters in the last year. Valeo Beta V Spock will pull his Vulcan weight in Event use, and will be one of the better SCI/SEC Spock variants. 

At launch, you’ll get two collections with a possible three more joining over the long years of life this game still has in it. Pay no mind to his ship abilities or Gauntlet use, but feel free to put him as your ride-along crew if his event happens to be a Skirmish. 

But that wouldn’t happen, after all, WRG doesn’t do full Skirmishes anymore. Nope.
