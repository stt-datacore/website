Diplomacy at the end of an...arrow? We are all Ahab on this blessed day as we wait for our 6-pack white whale to show up in another pack or enter the portal down the line. Troi's name is scattered across the tops of several different voyage metrics and the requisite Troi splash of MED takes the sting out of yet another DIP primary crew to make her one of the best voyagers in the game.

Her weekend work is wunderbar as well, as a double-digit event count and strong bases combine to give her priority shuttle seating. If you had your choice of one vanity crew to take home from the store, make it Radio Flyer Troi.
