You probably don’t want to touch this one (get it?) as the Hologram trait would appear to be her best bet for sustained value, but if your concerns are only for the immediate, there are certainly worse options out there than Losira. 

If you can’t get your hands on Major Kira, who is a fairly direct upgrade in non-voyage areas, Losira’s dual-mission eligibility may come in handy for Tuesday and Thursday cadet SEC work. She’s also a competent voyager, for however long you may be using Uncommon crew on voyages. Feel free to ignore Losira as she’s not a cornerstone building block on your Timelines journey, but we don’t always get to pick our companions.
