Crusher's skill set carried her for a long time, but the numbers simply aren't there anymore. Yawn-inducing voyage, base, and event rankings with gauntlet pairs that require hefty amounts of crit to function outside of the early game.

Still, the MED/CMD wasteland should at least allow Gates to net you a few wins there if you’re at the helm of a young roster and at least her collection value is realized and not theoretical. If you’re a big vanity collection fiend, keep in mind that this crew is not 100% retrievable so you may want to take her now if there are no strong options flanking her.
