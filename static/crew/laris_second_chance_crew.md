Cash or GTFO is the name of the game for the first of the Über campaign legendary crew. But what lies beyond the assorted campaign goodies and top notch sultry theming? 

Laris is a gauntlet gold through and through. An almost polar opposite of Security Laris’ base and voyage-focused build with a boring skill set, this Stewart-hunting variant swings in the other direction and comes with a hundred easy crew comps for her gauntlet efficacy. Defensive Phlox for the identical proficiency total, Bartender Guinan for their very similar DIP/MED, and her skill set is an amalgam of pairs that various gauntlet exclusive crew are famous for.

While she doesn’t quite hit the heights of most of those examples due to no massive single roll or 45%+ crit sets, she’s certainly reliable. Laris parlays a huge number of elevated crit sets and juicy skill set into strong flexibility across different gauntlets with plus versatility due to an ability to leverage a respectable roll in a few different skill pairs that don’t often see walls of one crew.

Outside of the pit, her reasonable spread of traits should see Laris’ event possibilities bounce from mega to mega while also bolstering her other selling point; a collection quartet that should see Romantic join their ranks before too long.
