Lieutenant Watley was checking out Bashir's open flap on this card's release, but his haircut stolen from your dad's 1970's college photo is starting to win out. 

A voyage rank in the triple digits is a blinking neon sign, even for a great skill set like Bashir's. If he comes pre-packaged with 3+ stars in another re-run of his big bonus feature, that may change things a bit and he would stand out from the sea of CMD/DIP/SEC+SCI, but it's not an attribute to chase through beholds.

His traits are a different story, however. A handful of collections with a little room for expansion is all we need to say to get veteran players to bite. Even though Bashir variants are loaded with MED and it's a tricky skill to find enough seating for in a Faction event, 1701 Bashir is a fine late game grab on the back of his trait potential and he should drift in the middle tiers for quite a while.
