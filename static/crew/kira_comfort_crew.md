We were all hoping "Comfort Woman Kira" would bust out some badass catch phrase like "Comfort this!" and kick Dukat and that fat, creepy Cardassian out a hole in the side of Terok Nor. It didn't happen, but in game she's still someone to hide behind when the fighting breaks out.

Being in the shadow of older sister Breen Disguise Kira on voyages is a tough pill to swallow. Them sharing the same skill order and several traits is sub-optimal for Luma Rahl, though on her own merits she does about as well as a CMD/DIP/SEC crew can. Good debut power earns her an extra year or two in service than most awful voyagers released around her, even factoring in the skill sets.

Kira's mouth-watering trait set measures seven deep without being bloated by the top five largest pools including Human, Federation, or Starfleet. That's generally a clear signal that a crew is likely to either improve with age or at least decline less rapidly as her traits trigger collections and event bonuses in the future.
