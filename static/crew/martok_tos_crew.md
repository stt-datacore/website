Long lambasted by players for milquetoast stats and being ugly as sin, Martok's numbers have caught up to his reputation. Boring from most angles, but with a few trait event options, Ol' Blue Eye is a crew you wish was a super rare that you could thaw twice a year, rather than have him hog a crew slot. But if you're keeping him out anyways, his six (!!!) different 45% gauntlet sets are fine for a lark or as an early-game option, give his limited proficiencies and stiff skill set competition.

It's almost a shame that this reviled card is such a collection hoss, and yet... Klingon and Costumed will be paying dividends for years, while the Originals are an interesting vanity group and Veteran is more than large enough to warrant expansion. If you're in the late game and a theoretically stronger behold choice might only be used once or twice a month on your roster, you can feel free to indulge in this ugly, but refreshingly interesting vintage of 2279 Martok.
