Delta Flyer Kim is what you might call a stocking filler card - yes, even though we're in May, shut up, the analogy still works. He's very much not an exciting card, nor is he particularly bad; much like a pack of thin mint chocolates or a Top Gear DVD that you know your mother bought from the budget store, you'll eventually enjoy using him down the road in one of Kim's eventual Faction events, and if you haven't been cultivating your CMD/ENG, you'll find him palatable until you find a better upgrade.
