Some performances stand the test of time. Queen at Live Aid. Led Zeppelin at the Royal Albert Hall. Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. Beyoncé at Coachella. Varani at the Jalanda Forum…

Can Varani’s place in Star Trek Timelines ever hope to say the same? To be blunt, no. But he’s not washed up quite yet! He has a few tricks (and tivara sonatas) up his sleeve that will make sure you don’t forget his name.

In a game replete with seemingly infinite permutations of CMD/DIP Voyagers, this DIP/CMD/SCI offering promises to take his place amongst the elite, at least for a bit. While most players will have received Pathfinder Uhura thanks to the giveaway, Varani can take the place of a number of other top crew should previous Events, Pack Pulls, or Gauntlet RNG(!) not gone your way. Those with deep rosters featuring the likes of Lt. Commander Spock, Inspiring Captain Burnham, and Mirror Mariner will still drag Varani out from time to time thanks to top billing on his various AM seats, ensuring use at least in the recent future.

BigBase™ debuts are seemingly a dime a dozen these days, and Varani is the latest crew with a hefty DIP score to jump in and freshen up the appearance of your Daily Shuttler lineup. If that part of the game no longer matters to you, he will at least deepen your roster come Faction Event time, although with 6 Traits that haven’t seen much love over the years, that may be a tall order. At least said traits bring with them 4 Stat-Boosting Collections and a good shot at at least one more should WRG ever deign to release a Bajoran one.

At first glance you may even think he’s got a future in Ship Battles, however with only 2 Charges and a slower Initialization time than similar options (not even counting Demo Man Scotty, depending on your Captain’s Bridge progression), you probably won’t need him there if you’re an elderly player.

Like Triumph at the US Festival, it may take a special kind of fan to appreciate and recognize Varani’s Timelines iteration for what he’s capable of, before fading away into memory. But in the moment, embrace and cherish him until he’s reduced to a Skrreean holo-recording.
