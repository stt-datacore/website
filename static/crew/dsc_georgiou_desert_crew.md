Georgy girl holds the distinction of being one of only two legendary crew to appear in three stat-boosting collections. With 'Diplomat' being revamped to the tune of a 60-crew threshold, other similar changes may be in the works, which keeps Georgiou on the short list of best collection stuffers the game has to offer.

Her value otherwise depends on Discovery and variant events, of which there have been plenty. Even considering a trait set mostly bereft of value, Georgiou has collected multiple Faction events in each of the last three calendar years including TEN event bonuses in 2019. With or without a starring role in a standalone Section 31 series, Georgiou will have plenty of opportunity to pilot some class Fs for you down the line.
