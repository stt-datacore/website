FOB is the poster child for return on investment. She's only dropped three voyage ranks (and one base rank) over her first three years and may still be making runs when your toddler is accepting their diploma. CMD/SCI's value over replacement in that area isn't top shelf, but Burnham will remain a strong option while exotic skill sets with middling power have dropped from use entirely.

She's also been the event boss, grabbing fistful after fistful of event bonuses. With Disco blanket bonuses likely cooled off, she'll have to settle for merely 'very reliable' variant event work going forward to highlight a huge CMD score that can even perform non-bonus work admirably. Slow, triggerless arena damage is a great new player perk, but it's her stability as a behold and citation investment that has her sitting pretty among the top names in the game.
