Whether getting stranded in space or fighting an evil hologram of his own creation, Rutherford sure knows how to rock an EV Suit. An ENG base that would make Billups proud and Voyage viability for those with Legendary-starved rosters (providing AM boosts with 5 of his 6 traits) are his only daily-use calling cards, as sadly he won’t feature much elsewhere unless you’re into themed bridges. Luckily he can fall back on his 4 stat-boosting collections while he waits for the crew of the Cerritos to realize he’s gone missing. And really, who wants to Immortalize EV Suit Archer, Compromised Airiam, or A.G. Robinson? Because I don’t.
