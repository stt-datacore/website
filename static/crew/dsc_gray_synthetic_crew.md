Even without the potential of a hands-on-hips collection (scrapped due to the high percentage of Janeway variants they’d have to include), Gray’s traits will look to do the heavy lifting for his value moving forward.

A somewhat disappointing voyage profile for a new release should earn him use on many rosters through his first year in game, but more than that cannot be guaranteed. A pivot from there will need to include value spikes in the forms of events and collections. Four of his five viable traits have appeared as weekend bonuses already, while anything but Starfleet and Federation are legitimate collection possibilities as well.

Not an auspicious release for a character that was hyped up via player vote, but Gray is all but guaranteed to pop up as a name to know when his traits afford him that notoriety.
