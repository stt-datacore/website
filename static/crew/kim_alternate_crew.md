Alternate is a good way to describe a crew in Harry who's probably not coming off the bench any time soon. Debuting with a triple digit voyage power rank among purples and flaccid bases, his two perks are an unexpectedly impressive event clip and more importantly the Survivalist collection spot. A nice crew for veterans to snag during a lazy weekend or voyage skill set for brand new rosters, but with no real power punch.
