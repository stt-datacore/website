There’s no way Quark isn’t wearing Adidas tracksuit pants underneath, but still it should be fun to see the top of his lobes on your future bridge crew lineups.

Hit the snooze button and keep sleeping through any but the most powerful CMD/DIP/Something voyagers if that’s all you’re after in a crew, but with Quark’s top thirty debut in that area and towing a handful of fun Antimatter seats, it does make for a fine supplemental attribute to a crew who’s more of an overall package.

Eclipsing multiple variant events in all but one year (if we’re not counting the strike-shortened 2016), Quark has done solidly for himself, considering how little help he’s had from a trait lineup best described as viable. So, too, it is for collections where he could click up towards six or seven before we know it.

Collecting crew based on their event or collection futures isn’t for everyone, but when they do pay off, you look like a genius. And you know what's really frightening? If you collect enough of them, you begin to like it. It’s insidious.
