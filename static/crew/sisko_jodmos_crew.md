He's no dung beetle, in fact Klingon Sisko is pretty far from shit. Stout base and voyage numbers, a very steady event pace, and triple collections make him an ideal crew to offset a worn out skill set. Sisko's long been an underrated name for lush trait sets and Jodmos is no exception. Already proving out the theory with the addition of the Klingon kollection, we may see even more from his fantastic trait lineup, which also double dips in value to provide Faction event bonus opportunities for a SEC base that sits near 1100 with bonuses.
