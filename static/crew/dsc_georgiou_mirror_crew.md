Once eyed as a potential event queen straddling Mirror and Discovery futures, Philippa’s starry skies have materialized about as smoothly as a Vulcan science officer named Sonak. 💥 With Georgiou’s show presumably scrapped and blanket Disco events likely at an end, she’s no longer quite the ace in the hole we thought she was - instead merely competent.

As it stands, you’re gambling on a pretty thin trait pool and pure Georgiou star power to make her anything other than a collection piece with few traits viable for expansion, nay Conquest, in that area.
