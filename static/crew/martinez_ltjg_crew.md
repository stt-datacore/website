Like most of you, we had to look up Mr. Martinez on Memory Alpha to try and sink our teeth into this prolific extra. Since his character page there is infinitely more entertaining than this crew, let's chat about that instead.

The actor's name is Braveheart. That's pretty metal... "On several call sheets of The Next Generation, Braveheart is listed as 'Dr. Death' instead of his real name." Also metal... Between that little Easter egg and the number of Klingon extras he played, Michael Braveheart seems like a pretty cool dude.

Sadly, with his in-game crew you're really only getting a notch for the Physician collection and little else. Finish, Freeze, Forget.
