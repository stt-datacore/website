Did you know that there’s a fan theory that the reason why Starfleet changes their uniforms every five minutes is so that time travelers will know exactly which decade they’re in when they inevitably have to come back and sort out some shenanigans? It’s just about all I could think of as I look at Control Leland, looking almost identical to Covert Operative Leland, wearing the exact same uniform as Agent Harris a hundred years before, and Agent Sloan a hundred years later. Section 31 just really loves that Folsom Street Fair look, I guess, perhaps as a way to make up for their cookie cutter skill sets. 

Wielding a phaser rifle that testifies to his bonafides as a top ranked voyager, Leland substitutes diversity for power - fitting, for an AI driven meatsuit. While he may have been dinged by a few other contenders to the CMD/DIP/SEC crown, he's still a rock solid contributor on any roster, and he's a sizeable improvement over older, more dated, more widely available crew like prior mega crew like Kol, Thrax, or any number of event rewards.

With the Mirror collection's stat boosts only improving his CMD/SEC power (not something you can say about most crew), the most replaceable of skill sets can easily be stomached when it comes anchored to voyage potential like this. Just be aware that his fringe benefits are limited, and event chances hinge on Section 31, Discovery, and the outside chance of a Spy mega.
