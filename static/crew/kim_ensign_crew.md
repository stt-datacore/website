The worst engineer in the game. Okay I’ll rephrase that, the worst engineer for someone who has ENG as their main stat. No good traits, no extra collection bonuses. His ship ability actually makes no sense by increasing attack damage by reducing accuracy. This means he probably shoots himself in the face mid battle. Don’t even think of promoting him!
