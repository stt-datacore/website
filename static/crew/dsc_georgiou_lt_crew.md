There are certain cards that you just know have peaked in value. No untapped collection traits, inflated event tally from a now defunct tsunami of show megas… Not every card needs to have avenues to appreciate in value over time, but it sure as hell helps.

Exhibit A: Lt. Georgiou’s 2020/21 event history. Everyone should have seen that one coming, so even though she has pretty strong shuttle metrics, her thawpertunities will likely be few and far between. 

Exhibit B: About 220 super rare crew have two or more collections as of this writing and Georgiou is one of about a dozen multi-collection super rares with no clear chance to increase that count.

Again, her offerings as they stand are “good enough” to merit the behold choice in some cases, but as long as we’re playing in the eye of the collection hurricane, it can’t hurt to snag some more trait-rich crew or names that you can use right out of the box on a daily (or weekly) basis when possible.
