The Notorious K.A.R.R. is well known for the lowest primary base among super rares and the second worst 3-skill voyage total. But flying under the radar are his double collections, 65% gauntlet crit trait set paired with a top five CMD roll, and fantastic arena passives. Hold your nose when selecting him for his latter talents, but every roster will immortalize him eventually for the super tough Costume Party collection.
