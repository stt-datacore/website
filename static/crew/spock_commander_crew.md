The dirty little secret about Timelines is that Common crew really don’t matter. Those first few airlocks can be hard to stomach and then it gets easier. But if they did matter, we’d all be paying through the nose for Spocko.

A traity son of a gun, any gold would be salivating over his girthy event history. And boasting maybe the best collection-to-build cost ratio in the game, his traits once again show up big to make even veteran players look under the couch cushions for more credit pulls if they don’t have him. While his overall weak, rarity-locked stats won’t see him meaningfully contribute alongside Rare or Super Rare crew, he’s still a fine crew to immortalize early on with Uncommon IDICs as his only required faction items.
