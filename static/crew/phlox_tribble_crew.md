Some characters are prone to becoming collection magnets - Phlox and his physiciany, exobiology-y attributes qualify. Pushing him into the upper echelon of skill boost goodness are another pair of traits courtesy of the episode he comes from. Quad collections are a bounty and while that area of the game may sometimes be ascribed to long time players only, at some point it just becomes too much value to not welcome with open arms, even if you only have eyes for daily (or weekend) work.

Outside of the collection realm, Phlox doesn't wow. Base, voyage, proficiency, and arena metrics are all blah and despite a batch of interesting-to-good variants, Phlox doesn't get too many events. A dash of MED will have made him a nice pickup for new players who were there for his introductory event, but if you're chasing him one star at a time, make it for the purse bulging with gold collection coins that accompanies him.
