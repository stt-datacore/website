Suder doesn’t belong on any active rosters, but if you’re looking for a reason to snag a great on-screen character, pray to the Circle of Traits which seeks to bring all crew to relevance in time.

His six non-HFS traits are all varying levels of reasonable when it comes to collection potential and indeed he has a higher ceiling there than most, though it remains to be seen if WRG goes the direction of a Troi-heavy Betazoid collection or Vulcan-esque Telepath collection. With bad bases that would take many requisition shuttles to find a spot even with a bonus, Suder is a collections-or-bust dice roll in otherwise bad beholds.
