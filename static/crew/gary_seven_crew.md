Gary's known on a first name basis to players, much like Grebnedlog and Minuet. Except...in a good way. A former Voyage deity, Gary has felt power creep but perhaps not as strongly as his less-well-endowed (in Voyage power, jeez… get your mind out of the gutter) peers, and has only now started to fade into oblivion for endgame rosters.  

Gary loads torpedo tube two with a potent Gauntlet warhead. A trio of ranked pairs including the top overall SEC/SCI roll are supported by two huge single rolls that give him underrated flexibility to avoid having to wait for just the right skill combo to pop up like most 2-skillers do. While not oppressively strong like certain Gauntlet exclusives or boasting a number of high crit gauntlets, Gary is a versatile choice to shore up multiple skills at once. 

As Mr. Seven begins to tumble from the apex of his Voyage powers and as more and more Gauntlet Exclusives get released faster and faster to erode his value, his Traits shall have to buoy him. Unfortunately his Trait list is quite thin, but potent. He has found one stat-boosting Collection and a fun inclusion in the Pet People Vanity (thank you Isis!) and could find himself with a quartet before long. Grab star one for Gauntlet, and perhaps let the other stars find you in time.
