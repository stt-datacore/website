One of the best voyage skill sets in the game marred by that tiny little caveat of having 650+ crew ahead of him in raw power. This isn't 2017 anymore so don't go all soft lens on his skill set - it's not hard to find better options unless you can fully fuse him very early on in your Timelines journey. 

Elsewhere he's at least serviceable with an admittedly easy-to-complete collection spot and a mouthwatering smörgåsbord of traits and variant events to elevate poor bases enough to give him plenty of whacks at the requisition piñata.
