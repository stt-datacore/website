Most people don't think "powerhouse" when they see Quark's shapely lobes, but this variant very nearly is. Great voyage numbers with the second best MED of anyone in the top 30, two very usable bases for Quark's double-digit events, and +1 Ferengi collection. Only 11 Ferengi items required to FE make him a bargain.
