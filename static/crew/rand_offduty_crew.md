Perhaps the most fitting crew to debut in the not-romantic, but scoundrel mega, Rand is mostly around to eat up your crew slots. Her ENG kicker won’t save a flagging voyage score that hits on only the three most common anti-matter traits and while her bases might be okay to thaw, she simply won’t get many bonuses due to a lack of eventable traits (thus far).

Without name brand value or much potential collection value, feel free to avoid this Janice in beholds until she shows more tangible value.
