In the vein of an Evil Kirk or ‘Ultimate Evolution’ Riker, Proto is a freezer body who you’ll thaw a few times each year to boost your Faction shuttles. His shot at daily use lies in the arena and is a curious thing. 250% instant damage is a little better than average for super rares without a trigger and pairing it with a six second fuse is juicy, but it comes at the price of a hefty accuracy handicap. It’s hard to know what to make of it in a vacuum, but should be worth playing around with if you aren’t happy with your current setup. 

Who had primal in the office collection pool? Somehow his Rikerian Gambler trait snuck through the censors (we won't tell if you don't) and he has a little room to improve there, but even a lone collection makes crew worth acquiring for many. Proto Riker isn’t nearly as ugly as the character, but his use is fairly narrow if not utilized on ships.
