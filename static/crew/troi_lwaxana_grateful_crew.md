Carrot Top is far less flashy than her dress sense implies. The event work is nil, the skill set is ðŸ’©, and the traits are thinner value than they look for weekend bonuses while having no proficiencies to latch onto in the gauntlet. "So why the fuck is she ranked here?" First of all, watch your fucking language - this is a children's book.

The nature of power creep dictates that with the requisite number of stars, she will be used on almost any roster. Knocking handfuls of old mega crew off certain voyage combos or those same Kols and Thraxes from shuttles too. She'll drop in value faster than other crew, but if you're a Majel fanatic (so say we all) and want an honor project off the beaten path with the promise of progress towards those last few Diplomat tiers as a sweetener, you can be grateful to have this power creeped variant of one of the most joyful characters in Trek history.
