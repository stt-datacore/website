His gumbo sure is smellin' good, but it's the rest of this card that stinks. Poor [_Grandpa Joe_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YnJR54moKA) doesn't collect event appearances from his son or grandson and his bases barely crack 1k when fused. Even a respectable DIP proficiency gets stomped by the likes of Surak and Locutus in his only ranked gauntlet pair. Leave this card to the collectors.
