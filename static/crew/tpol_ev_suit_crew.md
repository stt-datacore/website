EV Suit's sunset scorecard is not unlike those of almost all of her other legendary variants, Twilight’s gauntlet ability notwithstanding. Meaning as a standalone crew, there’s not much here in the way of intrigue, but at least she’s a serviceable event piece.

As one of the few ENT characters to get any love from WRG and in combination with trait bonuses, T’Pol’s shuttle-friendly skills should have an easy time finding seats for events in which she has a bonus. Some middling collection value and a “win with your favorites” arena ability offer other reasons for stacking some stars and make her a reliable if unexciting crew to try and extract long term value from.
