Killy rules the ship battles with an iron fist and is similar to gauntleteers in that if you have a chance to grab her first star, you do it. Pair her with some fast activating crit crew like Ardra/Karr/Scott and rake in the rewards from three second ship battles. She can save you hours of gameplay over the course of countless arena dailies and skirmishes and unlike the aforementioned gauntlet counterparts, does benefit well from extra stars (you’ll want to get her to +9/10 attack for those one shots or spend another seat for an attack crew).

That being said, Killy’s usefulness is clearly on the decline. Her event count is propped up by five previous mega events and though that may or may not continue, her variant events have been strangely lacking. Discovery (her primary event consideration) CMD options have sprung up around her and her voyage work is well below average. Several crew introduced in 2019 have encroached on her arena credentials which also steals some of the value that came from its exclusivity. She remains well rounded and the impact of her shipboard work is significant, but a sinking relative effectiveness should be considered, especially on the topic of adding stars.

It's also worth noting that the speed up change to ship battles has turned anyone with a triggerless insta-damage into a pretty good approximation of Killy's former monopoly. She's "the best" in her realm, but competition abounds.
