The Bynars are cool. ↑ they certainly make a good candidate. ↑ Two skill non-event shuttle crew rarely make for exciting or valuable crew, ↑ With no gauntlet contributions, mediocre bases, no collections and few eventable traits, ↑ That being said, they aren't as bad as their fused form relative to the investment, ↑ Whether or not this defeats the purpose of them is arguable, but what isn't is the fact that these are crew bound for the freezer, ↑. being much more interesting in concept than it is of actual use. :)
