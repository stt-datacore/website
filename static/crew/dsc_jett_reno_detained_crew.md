A little Tig, a little Disco goofiness, and a heap o’ traits are the recipe for a campaign crew aimed at wallets everywhere. A (small) step down in voyage ability amidst a run of power hitters, Reno still holds her own there with a heady anti-matter rate and strong skill order that may as well be one of a kind. She’ll be making plenty of voyages alongside contemporary bumble bees Hollow Data and Enterprise Pike.

And as you might have gleaned from the thoughtful and innovative campaign announcement(s), she’s been known to have a collection or two after work to relax. With a value floor and ceiling both above average in that area, it’s some surefire kryptonite aimed at veteran players looking for reasons to cut back on spending. Even as her daily efficacy slips over time, collections and a mega-fueled event history should keep her in crew retrieval contention.
