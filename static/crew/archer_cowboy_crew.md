A formerly formidable daily use option, Archer’s stat ranks have taken a tumble over the years, but we’re predicting an upswing in value in the future. Still a surprisingly relevant event option, WRG/DB suddenly remembered Jonathan a few years after the game started and haven’t forgotten him since, giving him enough event bonuses each year to put his shuttle-friendly skill set to use.

His several untapped collection traits will be the meat of his value for many players and may translate to further weekend work if triggered alongside mega events. Although NS Archer is currently skippable for most players, he could blow up in value if the RNG wheel spins right.
