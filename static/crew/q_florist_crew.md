The collections headline here - John Luck Pickerd's beau is the only cadet-level option to grab that first skill bonus from The Continuum consortium and his spot in the monstrous Costume Party is equally valuable en route to one of the most ample sources of bonuses in the game.

There's also a reasonable amount of cadet work here. A fairly unusual combination of DIP and SCI in amounts high enough to crit certain Sunday nodes (thanks to generous top end rolls) is really only matched by the dual-eligible Mara. If she's unavailable to you, Florist will be able to handle multiple nodes in four of the five Sunday missions, with perhaps a smidge of early game shuttle time and shipboard instant damage.
