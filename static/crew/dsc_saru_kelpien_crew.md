Collection roads take me home
To the place I belooong

A five+ Collection Super rare is an automatic acquire, full stop. Even if WRG's crazy train of Collections claims as many victims as they can, you're still paying a nominal equip cost to make progress toward boosting all of your Legendary and six star überLegendary crew (I'm from the future. London Kings in six games).

Beyond that, you're mostly looking at a somewhat surprising Event crew. The end of regular Disco Mega Events left a lot of niche crew in the ditch, but Kaminar has done pretty darn well for himself in the years since, notching plenty of bonuses and a handful of Saru features too. While not the picture of daily use, this is still a crew that you (and everyone) should acquire.
