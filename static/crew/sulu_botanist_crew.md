You maniacs! You blew it up! Goddamn you all to hell! - Alright, maybe Mr. Heston’s apeish outburst is an overreaction, but he knows what you may not - the original art for this card looked much more like Hikaru Sulu than the finished product. Luckily for the players, something else out of character for a Sulu variant is actual, honest to God usability.

Sulu and friend debut atop the (unboosted) voyage power charts with a skill set that doesn’t completely suck. Despite a wasteland of value outside of that area, Gerty helps kick Sulu’s power into overdrive and should afford this duo the opportunity to voyage alongside your partially fused gold crew as you transition through the mid-game. Things look grim in the long term, but enjoy their fine voyage usability while you can.
