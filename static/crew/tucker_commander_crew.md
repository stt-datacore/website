Nothing special to see here. Iâ€™d rate him lower but he does fill out the Jury Rigger collection for a modestly cheap price. His ENG stat is fairly poor and his CMD stat not even worth talking about. No real use in cadets and a lackluster ship ability. Consider spending a few more credits and chronos working on other engineers.
