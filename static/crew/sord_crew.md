The Re-TAS-sance of new crew inspired by The Animated Series continues apace, joining recent additions Em/3/Green and Shiboline M'Ress. Dare we hope that someday, WRG might see clear to add "Spock Two" to the game? (Not to mention the Lower Decks gang -- a fan can only hope.) 

But, back to the Gecko Guy at hand. In the "pros" column, he debuts as a Top 100 Voyager, with a 400% Instant Attack move with a 6-second spin-up on the Arena side. In the "cons" column: few Traits, and the ones he has appear unlikely to help much for Events. Also no Collections, and in all likelihood, he'll never get any variants.

So Sord's value mainly comes down to Voyages and Ship Ability, and admittedly he's decent on both counts. You just need to ask whether "iguana" some help in those areas, or you don't.
