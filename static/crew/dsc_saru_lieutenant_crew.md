It’s a close call between the top Uncommon SCI crew but Saru is a worthy contender in that category. He’s a solid choice to run SCI missions and his Ship Ability is solid for first time Arena use. Being an Alien and having a fearless SCI Base gets him a good amount of use in the majority of Cadet Missions. A healthy secondary CMD score will get him on your nascent Voyages and truly his lasting value for all players are the Collections he has caught with his nice Trait set; a four pack of them with a Trait set of just five.
