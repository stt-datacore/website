# The Problem

Since the demise of BigBook, CAB, et. al., people have been apparently harvesting assets and other data points from DataCore more and more, and it's putting the strain on the system which is paid for out of pocket by members of the DataCore team.

Therefore, we are activating the human-verification wall.

# The Solution

But, here's the thing.  DataCore is open source, and you really do not need to pull assets directly from DataCore. Navigate to this repository, clone it, build it, and run it: [asset-server](https://github.com/stt-datacore/asset-server).

We will restore access so that people can retrieve the `crew.json` file after we have mitigated the number of people attempting to collect assets from the website.
