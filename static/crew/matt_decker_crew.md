TOS collectors, eat your hearts out. The name of the Commodore's debut theme pack, 'Sad Stories', sums up this character and crew rather well. Beyond the surface-level ranks, Matt owns a single 45% gauntlet set, a peculiarly low SECondary base, single collection spot, and wields a 400% arena torpedo at eight seconds which is both handy and increasingly easy to find elsewhere.

Mediocre-at-best in all non-arena sectors - if you invest in him, make it for sentimental reasons and enjoy his fantastic captainâ€™s avatar until he's eaten by a giant tinfoil space worm.
