Whilst she is only has #18 DIP base skill her proficiency bonus easily pushes her up to a #7 average. A good example of a weekend worker whose traits will help with some tricky nodes during cadet challenges. Her ship ability isn’t too shabby either with +5 accuracy and a +10000 critical bonus. She’s not the best Diplomat in the early game but that doesn’t mean she’s without use.
