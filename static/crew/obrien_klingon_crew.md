Formerly worth using in most areas, time has worn down O’Brien’s sharp edges to a dull nub. His remaining value stems from traits which produce his lone bright spot; collection value. Above average there and with some room to grow, O’Brien is an obligatory pickup for late game players, if nothing else.

Although his base ranks reside in the basement, his traits have underperformed for weekend bonuses relative to what one might expect. Don’t be surprised if he rips off a few consecutive megas at any point.
