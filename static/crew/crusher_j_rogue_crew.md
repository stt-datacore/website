Dapper dressed. Spirit sipping. Security scoundrel. 

Tuesday trap. 

All words and phrases to describe this new, good-looking offering. If you hate Dilithium and want to try your ONE in NINETY FIVE odds, boy can you get an epic reward for your troubles! 

(no, you won’t get him) 

Rogue Jack Crusher leaps off the screen of Picard Season Three and into the game as himself – not Vox – and he’s just as good as his Borg counterpart. How good? Well, for starters, you get two collection pieces with at least 3 more to come. You’ll also get, for your Dilithium investment, a decent ship accuracy boost – though admittedly no one will be using him for that. Shuttle rider? You bet, all day long on SEC seats.

Where his strength lay is with those hybrid Crusher/Picard (SPOILER!) genes – Six AM Trait matches and a top 30 Voyager score (boosted or unboosted!) at launch. Sure, he’s CMD/DIP/SUCK, so you can blindly shoot down a ship's corridor at the nameless villains of the week and hit another, but just ask yourself – who doesn’t want the son of Beverly Crusher and a dashing Starfleet commander? No, not that one, the other one! Go away, Wesley, we didn’t call you.
