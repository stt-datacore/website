Fairly similar to the last Honor Hall entry, Borg Queen Seven, Kal’Hyah Worf is a fine crew, but not exactly a stand out in an area of the game which deserves them.

The go-to comparison for all Honor hall crew seems to be Kahless who was a voyage and gauntlet monster on release and is still serviceable in both areas. It’s a shame Worf couldn’t do his best Molor impression and snag competing proficiencies considering his traits support plenty of elevated crit gauntlets and his skill set would face less resistance than Kahless’. Alas, Worf is only an option there for a roster’s first few months before we look elsewhere for usage.

Worf (just barely) snags top fifty Big Book ratings for voyages and events on debut with enough traits to see both his event and collection rates climb in the future. He lacks a knockout punch in any one area, but should offer plenty of utility for his first few years in service.

Is that enough value to ask for 100,000 honor and four hard citations when event crew of similar power levels come along frequently? We couldn’t possibly presume to tell you how to spend your resources, dear reader.
