No, you haven't wandered into the Super Rare crew...those are Gangster's actual stat ranks. Yet he still manages to dodge those poor numbers and contribute. The gauntlet is Gangster's game and despite taking a beating there from recent crew additions, he still owns the #2 SEC/ENG ranked pair on the strength of his #1 overall SEC proficiency. A lengthy trait list has him popping up with 45% crit from time to time and helps make him a practiced Caretaker sniper.

Beyond that, he profiles similarly to many gauntlet crew - poor base and voyage numbers. There's a gulf in usefulness betweens stars one to five and even though his return on investment is poor compared to many cards, Spock events and good-for-super-rare bases should earn him Faction work at higher fusion levels, even if it's on requisition shuttles.
