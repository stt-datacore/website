Janeway's right hand man will be equally reliable for you. As I parrot for every SEC/SCI crew, there just aren't many options for that skill set and so the voyage numbers can be tossed out the window, or at least gently set outside. As of now, there are only five SEC/SCI crew rated better for voyages. Considering his solid base and a couple events per year to pair with it, he may not be a superstar, but you won't go too long without calling his number.
