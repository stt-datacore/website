A hilariously eclectic set of traits, some fun art, a player favorite skill set…the pieces are there for a banger crew, but the sum of Tendog’s parts ends up a disappointment.

Lacking a power punch on voyages, Tendog’s anti-matter situation is rather concerning to compound her issues there. You can’t throw a rock without hitting Starfleet or Federation crew, meaning current and future competition for their bonus seats should be plentiful. Temper expectations for this “Whoa, ENG/MED!” crew, though they should perform on most rosters for the first couple years. 

What their traits lack on voyages, they make up for in the collections tab. Solid, if not superlative, collection value gives players at least one reason to immortalize this adorable pair. With few events to date and a Lower Decks mega seemingly unlikely, you may not see a big return on their “Top ten” SCI base. You can find work for Tendog if you look for it, but they won’t demand usage like stat monsters often do. But that’s not why you’re citing them up, is it?
