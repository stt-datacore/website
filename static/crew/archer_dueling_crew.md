Ushaan's bases are...problematic, but with his event count suddenly blossoming in the back half of 2018, he at least has an occasional chance to make them relevant. Equally poor are voyage numbers that have a view of several 2-skillers breathing down his neck.

The best we can hope for there is a bit of help on a SEC deficient roster. His two most useful attributes are a SEC proficiency just outside the top 10 and a tough node unlock. His strengths make him most valuable as a one star proposition, rather than an investment.
