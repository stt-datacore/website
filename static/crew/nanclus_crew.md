Eight viable traits plucked from three lines of dialogue. Looks like someone is petitioning to join the Empire. No, not that one.

Nanclus is the type of CMD/DIP/WHATEVER crew we can get on board with. His suitable debut voyage power that we generally warn you off of with other crew of a similar skill set is a nice attribute to have, because he’s a sum-of-his-parts crew who’s worth immortalizing for a variety of reasons. 

His event clip, while modest, has been fairly steady and the process of collecting names with a bevy of viable traits generally beats out a results-oriented strategy in the long run. Most titillating for elder players is a collection profile that sees him top 100-ish in both current and potential value, meaning his floor is high and his ceiling is even higher. A crew with potential for nine collections, movies included, is catnip and should be an easy acquisition for players who are flush with his other offerings.
