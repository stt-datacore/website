Like many pre-power crept LaForges, Musketeer is a well-rounded crew with fingers in many of Wesley's pies (sorry for that mental image. It’s an episode reference. Just…nevermind). Owner of a sunset scorecard, Muskie can pitch in in more areas of the game than not.

In the casino, a Caretaker-sniping SEC/ENG pair hits 45% crit often enough to make him a worthwhile inclusion, even on established rosters. Adding in a steady event clip, strong collection profile, and six second arena ability gives him possibilities for work in just about every phase of the game, even The Next Phase.
