Thirsty for blue or green collectable crew, players are happy to see another non-legendary Andorian grace their rosters. This one’s not too bad either - it’s easy to get what Mariner saw in her.

Jen doesn’t pop off in any one area, but has several spots in which she can contribute. New players grabbing a few stars from her debut event will find adequate, if pedestrian, voyage numbers and a CMD base that plays for daily shuttles. Elder players will be intrigued by an eclectic trait set for collection purposes and some sporadic weekend event thawpertunities. Ironically not a blue chipper, but a fine piece to the puzzle.
