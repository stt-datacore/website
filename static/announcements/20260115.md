Introducing Resource Tracking<!-- end -->

# Resource Tracking Live in Beta

Beta now has a new selection under the player menu, "Resource Tracking."

This enables you to record your currency totals, and compare day-over-day.

This is an opt-in feature and must be enabled before it starts recording your information. The information is only saved locally to your web browser. Saving back to the server is not available, although it may become available eventually. There are features to let you export and import JSON and also export CSV spreadsheets.

Graphs and charts are coming soon!

To navigate to resource tracking, open the player menu and select 'Resource Tracker'.

Here is the link: https://beta.datacore.app/resourcetracker/

(Embedding the link opens another window where player data is absent, so it has been disabled.)

## Bugs
We are aware of a few bugs, but feel free to drop in to the [STT DataCore Discord](https://discord.gg/n37vWwBUpN).
