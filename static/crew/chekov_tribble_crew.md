Short version: 💩

Long version: WRG may very well be testing the market to see just how bad a crew can be while still convincing players to go for them solely to notch a collection. A mid-mega filler piece, Tribble Chekov is simply a copy/paste of the three year old(er) Dancing Chekov, right down to the exact same CMD stats.

There are no power notes here, nor interesting corners in the areas of gauntlet, arena, or traits. He is to the 'Tribble Trouble' collection what Grilka is to the Klingon collection. Avoid.
