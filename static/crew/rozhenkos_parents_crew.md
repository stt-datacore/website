They were adorable on the show, but are more of a pet project in game. If you're investing in a 2-skill crew, they have to be useful outside of voyages, but with no stat sniffing elite and their first bit of event work claiming not just one, but TWO of their traits at the same time, these two are better left pestering Chief O'Brien about the Enterprise specs and diagrams.
