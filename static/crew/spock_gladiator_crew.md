Powered by a stellar lineup of traits, as with most Spocks, Gladiator has the potential to see his value rise and fall over time. The biggest black mark against him is a voyage score that has been creeped out of regular usage for many players, despite his lengthy list of anti-matter seats and fairly useful skill set. If you’re not close to immortalizing him at this moment, it’s fine to ignore his voyage potential as you mull adding additional stars.

Which you’ll probably want to do for his event and collection potential. An absolutely loaded event history alternates between clockwork variant events and mega after mega after mega. His event clip should never slow down and his SEC base will be in play for all of them. Gladiator also boasts about two crew’s worth of traits and has a collection ceiling as high as any name in the game. He may not be a day-to-day option any longer, but still hits a couple high notes that you’ll want on your roster.
