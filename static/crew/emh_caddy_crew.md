As Jimmy Demaret once said "Golf and sex are about the only things you can enjoy without being good at". You can tell by Docâ€™s art that Tee Time is in full agreement, having just spent a few hours on the back Nine.

A tremendous voyager, Doc combines his plus skill set with an absurd anti-matter hit rate, essentially guaranteeing him a trait match with every voyage. Strong overall power there and a splash of MED should see him rubbing shoulders with partially-fused legendary crew as your roster grows.

Even elderly players will have a use for this Doc variant. His worthwhile collection profile is an easy acquire on its own, while an oft-seated DIP base sees enough event bonuses each year to provide thawpertunities aplenty for this very spiffy dresser.
