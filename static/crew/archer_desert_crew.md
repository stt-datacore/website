Bad timing by Desert Archer whose release comes on the heels of superior DIP/CMD/SCI crew like NE Pike from events and Professor Sato from campaigns. We'd never advise you to stop collecting good crew (if that's what Archer was) just because you have someone similar, but his skill set is not likely to be a weakness for most rosters. There's an arena niche he may fill for you as there are only two other crew who match his +10 accuracy and come online faster (Culber, Colonel Q), but that's generally not worth the price of fusion when faster, cheaper, and more crit-centric options abound.

A year ago (which is where his stats come from), we wouldn't even bother discussing Archer event potential, but now 'averaging' two bonuses per year is reason enough to mention his useable bases, even if his 'man and his dog' variant trounces him pretty soundly on everything but that #2 Archer SCI base, whatever you think that's worth. Considering a fairly bland trait set, you'll be hoping that DB doesn't forget the series captain exists yet again. Archer's stats aren't terrible against the field due to the glut of old castaways, but he excels in no area and will be surpassed by most new releases.
