As it turns out, you WOULD like her when she's angry. If you're a Kes fan, enjoy this long-requested version, because unless/until DB releases Sweaty Puberty Kes, this is likely to be her last appearance for a long time to come. Luckily, she plans to go out with a bang, starting with a Captain Killy copy/paste ship ability, which will always be worth its weight in Skirmish/Arena gold, no matter who it's attached to. She backs that up with a rare SEC/MED/SCI skill set that would find Voyage seats even if her total was 50 ranks lower, and two ranked Gauntlet pairs that, while buried behind heavy hitters like Armus, Locutus and the Phloxes, catch bonus traits often enough to make her a useful contributor. Her contributions end there, though, as her weekend work would only come if a stray Brutal/Prodigy event came along, and her poor bases wouldn't make much of an impact even if they did.
