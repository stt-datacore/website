No in-jokes here, Larkin’s Trek short was a steaming pile and I’ll fight anyone who says differently.

Which means that Larkin’s card pretty much fits, then. A skill set attractive to new players is mired in lousy voyage power thanks to his Grebnedlog-esque tertiary and thawpertunities in a post-Disco world are a big question mark, though Ed has a pretty plus trait set overall.

Those traits do provide his most notable value spot; collections. With the Tribbled collection seemingly a lock to expand at a glacial pace, by the time you don’t need all of those names, Larkin will probably be in three or four collections and overall still a fairly key gatekeeper for completionists.
