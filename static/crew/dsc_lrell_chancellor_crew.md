L'rell's inaugural note warned of an overcrowded DIP skill and the tenuousness of Discovery megas continuing. Look, .500 is a great batting average. Disco will never die, even picking up a collection along the way, and in conjunction with a skill set that’s as good as it gets for non-guaranteed retrieval crew, collections and weekend shuttles are indeed her two chances to shine.

There’s nothing that constitutes ‘must have’ status here, but as she lacks a guaranteed retrieval combination of polestars, you can forgo her tier to some extent if mulling her over as a behold option. Just be prepared to accept a crew slot-eating dud until she approaches immortalized status.
