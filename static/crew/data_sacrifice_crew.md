Android Goes Boom, a gripping independent film, will enjoy a limited run in arena and skirmish theaters across the country. Data's unique ability there does the highest amount (450%) of triggerless ship damage in the game, even if it's a bit slow to activate. Wonderfully thematic for this sacrifice variant, the one-time use and huge evasion penalty means you either end the battle with him or die trying.

It takes a lot to push a crew's triple collections to the second paragraph - his three appliable traits would make most super rares an automatic behold choice with so much overall roster power coming from collection boosts these days. Now you take those home, throw in a big ENG base, add some untapped traits and Data events...baby, you got a stew goin'.
