Em looks like a booger and kind of has the personality of one too. Big millennial energy coming off this guy who basically tags along as the Vizzini to the rest of The Brute Squad and quite quickly succumbs to a stiff breeze. Have I sold you on TAS yet?

Appropriately lacking the Survivalist Trait that a few of his episode compatriots have, Em does at least score a few Collections already and an ENG Base that could justify the hundred Merit thaw if he were to ever catch an Event. He’s the freeze and forget poster boy, but do yourself the favor of watching his quintessentially trippy 70’s Trek episode.
