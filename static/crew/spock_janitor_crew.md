An extraordinary 2-skiller, Laborer is built from the ground up to be the prototypical event crew. Both of his bases are variant-best (ENG by nearly 400 points), his event count is steadily climbing (Spock, Vulcan, Exobiology, Musician), and his twelve traits are second most in the game which gives him plenty of chances for one-off event bonuses. If you want to avoid starring up the likes of Captain Scott to finish your Jury Rigger collection, Laborer is there for you.
He's also a premier defensive tool in the area. A huge +10 EV at 4 seconds with a helping of shield repair on top is obviously great and can match nearly every early activating instant damage crew. None of the crew with abilities that exceed Laborer's +10 EV can activate that quickly and only one (Dancing Chekov) activates before 8 seconds.
