A mid-level CMD/DIP/SUCK debut aged a few years...I think we all know how that song ends. Now merely a Collection/Event combo platter, Old Lady Langer's ceiling there is admittedly higher than most. Just ask before installing the door knocker.

As her Collection count continues to tick upwards month after month, making her a more attractive option for veteran players, the Event half has let her down to date. It would be consistent with WRG's behavior in the recent past for her to catch Collection-themed Mega Events down the line and that same bland-for-Voyages Skill set would excel there. Until that happens, though, she's a dice roll with Collections as her only tangible value.
