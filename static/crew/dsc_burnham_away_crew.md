All-Terrain Burnham is her first gauntleteer variant and helps flesh out a well-rounded STT character. She parlays a top five SEC proficiency into two #3 ranked gauntlet pairs; both close enough to catch #1 sleeping if she brings a crit advantage. Despite numbers heavily tilted toward proficiencies, her SEC base is tops for a character who's always a threat to pick up fistfuls of events. Strong voyage numbers paired with a top tier skill set makes her the #2 SEC/SCI voyager in the game, behind only the esteemed Gary Seven. First Officer Burnham may hog the headlines, but the ATB can take you anywhere you want to go.
