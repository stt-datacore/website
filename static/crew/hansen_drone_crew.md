Winning the award for most metal crew, literally and figuratively, Herre Magnus might have been a Danish techno band frontman in another life. On your roster, however, he’s likely to get lost in the shuffle.

Seven’s Far (that’s Danish for father. I love the internet) is a solid hand on voyages, which is a fortuitous attribute to bring to the table for an event crew. New players fusing him up will find a cache of valuable Antimatter traits and a nice science led skill set - somewhat uncommon for Borg Super Rares.

His hefty SCI base should also earn him some shuttle work from time to time and a requisite pair of collections serves to round him out and lift him out of dud territory in that area. Magnus will quickly become an also-ran, but is a fine card on release and one that most every roster will come across eventually en route to finishing the Borg collection.
