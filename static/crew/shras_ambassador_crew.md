Owner of a huge DIP base, but with few events in which to multiply it. Despite that and the common skill set, will still be useful for newer players with above average voyage numbers and +1 Diplomat for long term benefit. +9 arena attack can meet or exceed what the more popular Rura Penthe Reed and Duras sisters offer.
