Any other two-skiller with utility this low would be buried in the mines of Rura Penthe, but Kirk is not just any other man. He's the quintessential event name who still holds a big lead over other variant DIP options. With a few untapped eventable traits and a base worthy of daily shuttles, the nattily dressed Admiral is ready to be pressed into service a few times each year, right from star one.
