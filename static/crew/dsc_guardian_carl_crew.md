For someone who allows others to voyage across vast distances of time and space, Carl ain't so great at it himself. But that's square peg, round hole territory. The few trait-match seats he finds on voyages early on in his lifespan are an ap√©ritif for the main course; collections.

Carl's spots in the two largest collections in the game are juicy bait for stat boost hunters and he augments his value with the Engineered collection as well. His sizeable event history, while heavily propped up by Discovery megas, includes help from his traits to give him the occasional chance to fill ever-present DIP shuttle seats and avoid a total freeze-and-forget label in the future.
