"Better than every other Sulu combined", shouted the newspaper boy in his flat cap. That headline may sell papers, but realistically it only makes Tribble Sulu a competitive option overall. That's still great news, even if no new ground is being broken with this crew.

Sulu's new age CMD/DIP/SEC skill set is a hair better than that dreaded triplet, but in concert with enough power should keep him in service on voyages for a couple years. The WRG Original also picks up a trio of collections and is far from the worst option for any of them.

Event work will be spotty at best, but a few nice traits and operational base should afford him a few chances to shine in the future and give him multiple angles of contribution.
