If you're looking for pizzazz, you've come to the wrong place. His stats are as bland as his skill set, but a #2 SEC base among Riker variants can still make an event splash twice a year. Between mediocre voyage work and a lack of notable fringe offerings, Riker's main (only) selling points are occasional event work and the best beard in the business.
