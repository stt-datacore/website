Whoa, that art. Red Angel redux may not smack you between the eyes like the original, but Edward Scissorwings here is still a gorgeous offering for those who look up from their spreadsheets from time to time. Alternatively: Burnham’s mom has got it goin’ on.

A rather basier version of the other Angel card, Gabbi is the first big SEC base to join the game in *checks notes* some time. That’ll play for daily shuttles, but she’s also shown some signs of weekend life post-Disco. We’ve probably been promising you that the Undercover Operative trait will do something for far too long now, but it and a few others have a fair chance of providing her a mega or at least a few standalone events to shine in each year.

Voyages are the most exciting aspect of this card as Gabbi seeks to continue the revitalization of a very bottom-heavy skill set. Punching above her raw score in expected efficacy thanks to a half dozen anti-matter traits and aforementioned strong skill set, you should expect at least a couple years of usage from her there, which is impressive for someone just outside the exclusive “later losers” power curve.
