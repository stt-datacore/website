Dale a tu cuerpo alegría La Sirena. Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegría y cosa buena. Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, La Sirena. Heyyyyyyy La Sirena!

An absolute monster on release, the OG Alice Krige Borg Queen card set the bar high. And with actress Annie Wersching’s passing, one would expect WRG to up the ante with this incarnation of the iconic Borg Queen. They’d be wrong.

Art aside, this card struggles to stand out. She’s above average compared to the field and worth acquiring if you like the character, but nothing special amidst months of “top ten base, top fifty voyage” releases. Shorter on traits (and therefore event tally) than Krige, Annie lags behind on collection value, making her potentially even less valuable than the six year old Borg Queen card for endgame collectors.

It’s hard to look a four star gift horse in the mouth for players who acquire the Queen from her introductory mega event, but once that passes, she may struggle to earn players’ retrieval or behold favor.
