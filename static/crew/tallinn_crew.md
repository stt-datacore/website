In the wake of the Second Collection Expansion by which we at the Big Book measure Timelines epochs - in case you're curious, we're in the middle of the Great CMD/DIP/SUCK Era - comes a newfound appreciation for crew who, up until now, would probably inch newer rosters over that easy starting gate of collections like Ferengi or Romulan while leaving elderly players grasping for value. This holds especially true for Tallinn; loaded up with a machine gun burst of three collections right off the bat, it's easy to see practically every one of her traits becoming a collection (bar Civilian) down the line. Now that's what we call value for all.

For those who are still using Super Rares on voyages, this is the kind of skill set and power that will anchor a roster even at lower star counts, especially hitting on rarely served AM traits like Romulan - frankly, if more golds were like Tallinn, people would find it a lot harder to skip events outright. Even her primary base is strong enough that it could be a useful event piece in the future, three of her juicy traits having hit on megas before, and while she doesn't qualify as a variant of Laris, the value is definitely still there if you haven't built up a strong vault of legendary crew. Age might not be too kind as she's supplanted by greater power and more valuable event names, but for now, this is a crew you want to finish and start using as soon as you can.
