Gross stats and a redundant skill set spell out that he’s not a daily use crew, but Garak may just barely make the grade as the weakest possible crew who’s still event-relevant. A thicc event history littered with trait and variant bonuses include a handful of big bonus features, none of which are re-runs.

Assuming he garners no usage on your roster, Garak will at least save you from immortalizing one more 2007 legendary crew from the garbage piles known as the Cardassian and Mirror collections. His value should grow there over time and combined with his big bonus features make him a fine option to passively add stars on in otherwise poor beholds.
