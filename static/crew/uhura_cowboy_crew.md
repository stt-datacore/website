The raw numbers would suit certain characters well, but they're torpedoed by a redundant skill set and limited event chances. That's not normally a concern for a crew who can offer value elsewhere, but it's just not the case for Uhura. The circumstances of her arena ability (12 sec/position/3 sec duration) are almost too much hassle just to snag some instant damage. Uhura's event spacing has actually been fairly consistent, but consistently infrequent. If you select her, it will be for her daily work with a twice-a-year bump for events or as a collector for two exclusive vanity collection spots.
