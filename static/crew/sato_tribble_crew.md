"If there was anyone else who could do what I do, you wouldn't be so eager to have me on your space ship." - The other Hoshi, not this one

It's true, this Sato isn't anything you haven't seen before, but that's sort of what makes her a great choice to go with as an event reward. Despite a redundant skill set of redundancy, the power is there for some early game voyages, her variants are few to help ensure thawpertunities for this one, and her collection should appeal to all players; new or established.

Some early-game-only arena metrics give her plug-and-play potential for players just starting out and help complete the template for the type of starter crew that Timelines should continue churning out to help the young'uns get up to speed.
