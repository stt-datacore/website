There's not much to unpack for Proto Worf. He's just what he looks like; a “screwdriver” crew who sits near the bottom of your toolbox. Despite being significantly less versatile than his big brother variants, Worf/Klingon events will always have enough CMD/SEC seats to justify beholding this primal in a pinch. With a consistent event pedigree and low end collection value, he’s a name you’ll notice a couple times a year once immortalized.
