Dathon at El-Adrel? Uzani, his army with fist closed. Voyages, shuttles…Sokath, his eyes uncovered. But WRG and Kayshon? Kadir beneath Mo Moteh.

Kayshon on The Cerritos…Gilgamesh and Enkidu at Uruk. The Children of Tama and the Federation…Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. So why is Kayshon such a Shaka, when the walls fell? Maybe Kiazi's children, their faces wet, but WRG…Chenza at court, the court of silence. LT. JG Kayshon is Temarc. The river Temarc in winter.
