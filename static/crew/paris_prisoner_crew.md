Fresh from his off-Broadway role in The Shawshank Redemption – and straight into your home via Tuesday packs, it’s Prisoner Tom Paris!

...What’s that, you already have Prisoner Tom Paris?  No, That’s Krenim Guest Paris.  You see, he was a guest there...yes, and a prisoner, but ....uh....see he has a prison jumpsuit now, and an ankle shack...oh my god, is that Mirror Tuvok over there?  Right there, behind you..look!
*runs away*

Yeah. Yeah, yeah....Tuesday packs are back, baby!  And what better way to celebrate the return, than with a HORRIBLE mixed behold pack with 44 options including the silently added and not announced Prisoner Tom Paris?  If you were brave enough to part ways with 1300 DIL per spin, you had a 1/44 chance in landing ‘Naughty Boy Tom’ as he’s known in the yard.  But should he be sprung from the clink to serve your roster, or left behind to break rocks all day?

Well really, the answer is quite simple – do you need a strong Paris card for Paris events?  Do you need a strong Paris Voyager (no, not Star Trek: Voyager – but Star Trek Timelines: The Game – Voyages) who fills five antimatter boosting seats?  If you answered yes to either of those questions, start baking a cake and remember to put a metal file in it.

If you answered ‘no’ to either of those, then tell the Prison Warden it’s going to be a long summer as Tom won’t be useful for much else.  Only boasting one stat-boosting collection, your daily shuttles, gauntlet and arena won’t help this felon find work.  Plenty of better options, like EV Suit Uhura, should be coming to a Portal Update™ near you soon and won’t have a mugshot to accompany her.
