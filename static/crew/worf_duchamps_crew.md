The huge Worf/Klingon/Hologram event count and collectable traits are certainly nice, but his stats and skill set tell the story of a crew whose likely ceiling is as a fourth Faction shuttle seat warmer. No lack of opportunity to excel there, but he has quite an expensive build consisting of over 100 faction items and pricey components.

He’s a fine speculative crew to add stars to as his collection value is sure to grow, but he may take some time to pay back the cost of admission.
