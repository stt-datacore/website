It’s only logical that a Security Chief in a space suit would be good at…shooting things in space. Instant Damage at 6s is a huge boon for any budding Arena player in the Commander ranks, and a top option for players of all levels taking on the Normal difficulty in Fleet Boss Battles.

His Voyage numbers are top notch and he will be one of the first to sit on any SEC/CMD Shuttle seat while you work on expanding your Super Rare portfolio. Throw in a spot in two Stat-boosting Collections for which he's practically essential (plus a list of Traits that are begging for ones of their own), and you’ve got yourself a crew to make even a Hirogen Alpha lick his chops.
