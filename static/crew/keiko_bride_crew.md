When evaluating new crew, it's often useful and instructive to use "comps," or crew that compare closely in skill set and relative power, to see how they stack up. So, let's look at some comps for Bridal Keiko, shall we? Harcourt Fenton Mudd. Lenara Kahn. Loqueque Sato. Joseph Sisko. Orion Vina. Oh my.

Let's try to find some positives. Her art is good and unique for the game, and her ship ability is certainly useful enough, if a tad slow (Side note: whoever came up with the idea of "I Do!" dropping 400% instant damage deserves a raise) 

Unfortunately, there's not much else here to recommend. Her event count is dismal, her traits ensure that won't get better, and she has no collection value.

So before you take Bridal Keiko as your lawfully wedded crew member, consider us the man in the back yelling "I object!"
