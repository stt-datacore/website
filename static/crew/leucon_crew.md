We already have a bad dad joke in the Big Book (Dick Bashir also hanging out in this debut 6-pack), but at least Leucon's card stats aren't nearly as despicable. Mark Sheppard fans (from every TV show ever) should feel vindicated if they luck out and acquire this crew - he's got impressive voyage credentials to hand wave otherwise narrow utility and earn him long term roster usage.

The top voyage ranks have historically moved at a glacial pace, and while you might be lamenting a lack of MED for this bio-engineering geneticist, Leucon at least dominates his skill set competition on voyages and is a near lock to still be a top 10 voyage name to open 2021. ENG/SCI voyagers may be crowding out the lower end of the voyage ranks, but up top, they're curiously thin, so even a semblance of power will go further than you'd expect.

The utility gulf is massive when looking for other contributions from this crew; the most notable of which is a ranked gauntlet pair which has a few 45% crit trait sets, but will be easily manhandled by The Caretaker and even global gift Survivalist Kirk. In the debate of utility versus raw power, it's clear which side Leucon comes down on.
