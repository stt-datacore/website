"I’m Not Picard" he says and gosh darn it Benjamin you're right, because at least most Picard variants are useful. Okay that was harsh. This is a fun moment between Q and Sisko, but this card is never going to be a knockout star.

If he were to get into the ring with a bunch of other SEC/CMD crew and have battle royale to find who wins that prestigious title to board a failed voyage, the “Jambalaya Frya” would probably be knocked out in the first few bouts. His fighting moves are sublime, but when you are up against heavyweight champions of the sport like High Roller Sisko and Redjac “Dark Devil” Jaris then you had best quickly find the bookie and rescind that bet.

His signature move is a decent 325% gut punch in the Arena - fine as a one-star help, but a step behind many retrievable options. Fisticuff's primary use for long time players is as High Roller's little brother in Sisko events, but he does well there and a trio of non-HFS traits will govern the rest of his relevance in the event and collection tabs.
