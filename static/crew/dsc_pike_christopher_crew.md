If this is the man you're counting on to buoy Jeffrey Hunter's Pike card to relevance, it's time to let that dream go. Instead, crack open a nice, cold, refreshing Disco Pike. There are some fringe benefits here, but the main usefulness you'll glean from this card lies in the good ol' base and voyage work.

The CMD ranks are quite Disco heavy already so Pike's base sits behind a few common names. Still strong for Factions and daily shuttles, even if it doesn't carry the dominance that a Tilly or Culber enjoyed for over a year. On voyages, he ranks in the top half which gives an otherwise terrible skill set the opportunity on some rosters to contribute a CMD primary in the same amount as the heralded Mirror Jean-Luc Picard. While he may seem less and less worth it to sink resources into as time goes on, Strange New Worlds may yet buoy this card into relevance once more, so don't give up on ol' Chris just yet.
