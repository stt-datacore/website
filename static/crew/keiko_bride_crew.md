When evaluating crew, it's often useful and instructive to use "comps" or crew that compare closely in skill set and relative power to see how they stack up. So, let’s check out some comps for Bridal Keiko -  Lenara Kahn. Loqueque Sato. Joseph Sisko. Orion Vina. Oh my.

Well, her art is pretty cool.

Keiko is more or less just a ship damage option and even though she may catch a mega or two in the future and, yes, there is an art file floating around for the Botanist collection (fight me, WRG), there’s nothing she offers that other crew can’t cover while pitching in greater utility.

So before you take Bridal Keiko as your lawfully wedded crew member, consider us the man in the back yelling "I object!"
