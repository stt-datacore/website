Lacking traits and with a Klingon mega in the rear view mirror, Antaak's pair of poor bases have become little more than an oddity. Buoying him to bit player on most rosters is his trio of Episode 9 medical node unlocks (geneticist), a 65% gauntlet trait set which pairs with power good enough to make him a once-a-month visitor to your starting five, and dual collections. Be ready with Augment faction items and not Klingon ones before leveling.
