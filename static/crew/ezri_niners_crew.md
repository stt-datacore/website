Aging like a fine wine, not unlike Nicole de Boer herself, Ezri’s dash of MED and competent voyage power continues to keep her ability in that area the headline for this card and serves rosters of all sizes well. Somewhat light on anti-matter traits, she still has other supporting components that should ensure another few years of voyage ability for just about every kind of player.

In the meantime, Ezri’s collection count has ticked predictably upward and has room to continue doing so. Those same plus traits have also been a wonderful event pillow to ensure a minimum of three bonuses in any given year and could certainly be chosen for a series of megas in the future to continue to supplement Dax’s stellar event tally.

Throw in a “win with your favorites” shipboard attack boost and YMCA bridge crew art and there’s plenty to like about a crew that should be near the top of many behold and retrieval priority lists.
