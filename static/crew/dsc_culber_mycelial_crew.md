Long heralded as the best MED Voyager in the game, Culbs flew that flag at a time when he was the only primary of that sort in the top fifty Voyage scores. And while there's a bit more to him in other areas, that remains his primary point of interest. Great debut power and contributing to the MED/CMD stack, Culber could see use in that area on rosters through the year 2024.

Workable Proficiencies make him an occasional rotational option in the Gauntlet for more complete rosters, but certainly a nice get for new players. His Skill pairs rarely face walls there and he catches elevated Crit in enough Gauntlets to 2-for-1 bigger and meaner crew that show up with single SCI, MED, or CMD rolls.

Great Voyager, Citation worthy, superb art...Mycelial is an all round fun-guy!
