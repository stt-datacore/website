Our listening post lost all its glow
The day that it lost you
But he gained all his glitter the day you said go
And his silver turned to blue

Mr. Blue announced his arrival with a bang, bringing hope and inspiration to couch potatoes everywhere. No matter how many decades you've spent in the same room, you too can be recognized as the greatest explorer of your generation.

For crew who debut at this power level, skill set matters less. While the concept of 'value over replacement' still exists, Sahil doesn't have much competition for daily voyages and where he does, in steps a six-pack of anti-matter traits. When the rank projections have a crew inside the top ten after a year and top twenty after two, you smash that acquire button and let the other chips fall where they may.

A front loaded crew, Sahil lacks broader utility, but does manage to pick up multi-collection status thanks to the very generously applied Resourceful trait and should be able to hit his perceived ceiling with a third collection. He may catch a mega or two down the line as tie-ins to selling collection-themed packs, but bet on the Leftenant for his tangible, day one voyage and collection value and accept anything else as bonus.
