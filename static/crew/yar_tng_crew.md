Pure SEC baby. Which is fine in the early-early game but moving out of the first Missions you will find her uses limited. Her Ship Ability will give you a taste of what late-game Arena use is like but once you get better Rare cards in your manifest she will probably be one of the first to leave. Long after you’ve used her for the last time she may keep paying off with up to one more Collection.
