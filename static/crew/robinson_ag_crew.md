It may be one of his traits, but very little about A.G. Robinson's card is actually inspiring. Having debuted with the worst voyage rank for a three-skill crew in the game's history to that point, Mr. Robinson was born into a kind of statistical irrelevance normally reserved for crew three or four years older than he is.

As the herald of the A Little Stroll collection, you would think the news would be better on the collection front, except that, as of this writing, over three hundred other legendary crew join him in “boasting” multiple collections.

With an ENG primary that can have trouble finding seating in events and a putrid secondary SCI, A.G. has already settled into the low end of the hoards of event/collection-only pieces which you’ll want to (or be forced to) passively add stars on.

He may cut an impressive figure in those spiffy orange duds, but statistically he's all dressed up with nowhere to go.
