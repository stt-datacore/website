I mustache you a question.  How do you grow a mustache? No, the real question is – do we finally have a string of good Legendary Boimlers?

Behold! Your latest giveaway freemium character that will bring years of joy, use and utility – Mirror Bradward Boimler.  Lower Decks is one of the three legs of the very stable Star Trek chair we all enjoy sitting on in 2023 – even if you don’t care for animated or the humor style of the show, you cannot argue that it is a pivotal reason we as fans and consumers have so much to enjoy right now.

So, what better way to celebrate the glorious empire we reside in than with a representation of the most feared man in reach of an agonizer? In reality, he had 9 seconds of screentime, and he’s a holodeck simulation, so there isn’t a lot to go on here. The episode “I, Excretus” has brought us a multitude of great in-game options, and thanks to a stealthy missing trait fix, Mirror Boims is certainly a viable choice for your citation.  Brad Boimler Legendary variants can apparently only come from this episode, and this freebie is arguably the weakest of the three, but even a weak Boimler is still pretty strong.  Originally released missing Human, Starfleet, and Hologram traits, the newly corrected loadout is fantastic for voyage seat bonuses.  

Mirror Brad (darB?) has had a few Events to his trait-credit, but outside of Event bonuses, he won’t make most ‘Elderly Players’ daily shuttles.  Some players may tinker with his Arena use, with +9 ATK, but the penalty to ACC and his short duration make him 5th on your bench of players. 

Currently you will only enjoy three Stat-boosting Collections – however the future is bright for our Mirror Universe boy (just don’t look into the light!) with 3 future collections likely to hit eventually.  Sadly, he’s just a slightly less impressive version of Borg Baby Boimler, whom many players earned from events just 3 weeks before his Objective Event debut here.

The episode “I, Excretus” has brought us a multitude of great in-game options, but much like having Mirror Mariner as a Gauntlet exclusive, Boimler misses a mark or two here.  

Brad Boimler Legendary variants can apparently only come from this episode, and this freebie is arguably the weakest of the three.  Glaring issues up front – he is missing Human, Starfleet, and Hologram traits.  In a game where traits matter because of Fleet Boss Battles and the upcoming feature that is said to depend in ways on traits as well, these omissions must be considered a fumble by the offense.  The traits he does have give only 4 voyage seat matches, where he isn’t the best choice unless you have a very young roster, and this is your first Objective Event Gold.

Since he’s missing Hologram as a trait, you will only enjoy three Stat-boosting Collections – however the future is bright for our Mirror Universe boy (just don’t look into the light!) with 3 future collections likely to hit eventually.

Halftime’s over, time to get back out there and win one for the crew.  Just remember, don’t throw any more Hail Mary passes to the other team, use your turn signal indicators, and make sure you give new cards the right traits before BigBook.app gives you a Tier ‘Eh’ for your lack of heart out there on the field.
