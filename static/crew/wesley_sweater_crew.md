I can’t actually think of a more useless card. Not only can he not perform in the weekday cadet missions due to not being enlisted yet, but he has no collection, poor statistics and all of his abilities are bested by the superior Acting Ensign Wesley card, which has all the same traits and ship abilities but better. Even his card art is wrong, I have a special tier for just how wrong this card is, Fire-At-Wil. Don’t even use him for the common collection, don’t even take the honor, just uninstall your game if he drops
