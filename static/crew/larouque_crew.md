Ye Olde Dukat is a collector's piece. Two-skillers are not worthy voyagers, meaning they have to bring it elsewhere. Unfortunately, Freddy falls short across the board. His lone notable attribute, a usable shuttle pair, is missing its dance partner; events. This leaves him mopping up in some daily shuttle duty where, if you don't worship at the church of Our Lady of Tanked Shuttles, he might bump up your success rate by a few percent.

In the crew eval game (humor me), we often compare crew to rock climbing; you want to maintain three points of contact with the rock to make sure you don't go tumbling down. Considering all the areas where he doesn't contribute, Mr. La Rouque is lightly brushing the cliff with one finger as he plummets to earth, making him a worse climber than Captain Kirk on holiday.
