The folks behind Timelines rarely give with both hands. Yes, Lara's the worst voyager they've ever released and yes, her art looks like a crappy sticker from some dress-up mobile game (wait a minute...*we're* playing a mobile game). But she's also the first non-exclusive power gauntleteer we've had in years.

Debuting with top ten proficiency, her SEC roll tops the list above Gangster Spock, her CMD/SEC pair matches Kahless, and her DIP/SEC pair is somewhere between Balok and Gowron - heavy names all around. It would have been nice for Lara to avoid the CMD/DIP/SEC clown fiesta, but her skill order and power level still gives her a lot of room to maneuver despite not eclipsing 25% crit in any gauntlet.

A few of her four viable traits have hit on collections already to help make stars two through five feel less awful, but if you wanted to leave her at 1/5 for a while and let beholds nibble away at that collection value over time, that's a viable strategy.
