Dehner Dehner Dehner Dehner Batman! I hate to be negative about such an iconic character, but there's not enough meat here for a compliment sandwich.

This was a crew we long warned players off of for a lack of both power and utility and just a few years after her release, she's essentially completely dead in the water. She's not a voyager, a shuttler, a gauntleteer, or an event crew. With her one-and-a-half viable traits, she does have collection "value", but should be one of the last possible crew you immortalize for that purpose. Feel free to @ me if the Telekinetic collection hits, because this really is a fun piece of Trek history worth nostalgizing about.
