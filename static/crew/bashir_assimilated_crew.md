The AssBash cometh? Too late, I’ve typed it and you’ve read it, please no one contact Eugene O'Neill’s estate. Cometh the newest Bashir does, and he brings a lot of great things with him! Collections? Check! BigBase™? Yep! Voyages? DING DING! Ship Battles? Huzzah!

Let’s start with Collections. If I had a nickel for every Timelines Original Assimilated crew, I’d have 15 cents, which honestly just goes to show how this is a fun mechanism by which to make Original Crew (and maybe pad the numbers in the Borg Collection). While the “other” artist may be guilty of a bit of cut and paste (One’s body plus a Captive Bashir face), the traits pop off for four current Collections (three Stat-Boosting) and have a shot at a couple more down the line.

On to those Base scores. Not only does he leap atop the ranks of Bashir SEC bases, he is surprisingly the number two SEC crew, and number two MED Bashir, at time of launch. Kind of makes you wonder how this DOCTOR has been treated in the game thus far, while also highlighting the effects of power creep. This will of course serve you well in Daily Shuttles and Faction Events for a healthy while.

If you couldn’t guess by his two strong Bases, he’s also a strong Voyager. The game’s first ever SEC/MED/CMD crew is default number one there, but also shines in the SEC/MED and CMD/SEC/MED-in-any-order Triplets. Though he falls in Surrogate Kira’s shadow, you can happily use him instead if you missed out (or are really into Trait Matching).

Lastly, if that wasn’t enough, we have a new contender in the Hull Repair ranks, especially for Fleet Boss Battles. Asshir joins the 25% Instant Hull Repair Club, coming in at a speedy 8s Initialization (ahead of Dereth and tied with Laborer Kirk). Sadly his 26s cycle will mean less uses overall, but for those out there who have yet to find themselves a copy of the usual mainstays, he could be your new best friend!
