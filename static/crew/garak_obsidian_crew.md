Shockingly, there isn't more to this simple tailor than meets the eye. Average numbers across the board with a skill set described the same. His best offering is a Garak event tally that nears double digits, and a regular shot at 65% Gauntlets with serviceable, if not amazing, rolls. None of his numbers are particularly appealing besides his steady event work, but he still has a cult following on forums as a solid crew. Who am I to argue?
