Most of us loathe the thought of collecting another DIP/CMD 2-skiller, but at least Uhura will shine in spots. For a time, she was among the best shuttle crew in the game, but now crowded out of that honor by handfuls of new crew, she waits for events which have crawled to a halt. One variant event in a year and a half won't pay the bills, which I guess is why she's resorted to dancing.
