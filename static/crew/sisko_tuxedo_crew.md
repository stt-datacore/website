The skill set won’t look great on the behold screen, but like his tux, Sisko is one of the very best to wear it. A multi-year reign as the top SEC base with regular event work would be good enough for most cards, but he throws in workable voyage power and eight anti-matter traits to go with it.

That delicious bevy of traits also gives him huge collection potential, but the most interesting outcome is the one he's already in. The more-than-a-vanity collection Bada-Bing rewards a big time power crew in Scapegoat O'Brien. With only three gold crew required to obtain him, that collection is more valuable than meets the eye and should outstrip something like a 1% skill boost for years, especially in the short term.
