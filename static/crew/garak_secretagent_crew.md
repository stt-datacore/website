Another simple tailor who we can surely take at face value. Elim's previous note sounded caution chasing traits with no daily use attached, but that's very nearly become the game these days. Boasting an elite theoretical maximum to his collection value and spot-filler shuttle status for an event tally that has underperformed thus far relative to his traits, this is about as good as it gets for cards of Garak's age.
