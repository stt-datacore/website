In an endeavour to get Captain Pike’s torpedo to launch, Rigel Vina is another bit of Talosian trickery. Vina is a relative non-starter save for two areas - A fantastic dress sense that might convince WRG to include her for Lwaxana events and a spot in what is currently the most skill bonus-heavy collection in the game. Behold and freeze, but don't feel the need to justify keeping her on your active roster.
