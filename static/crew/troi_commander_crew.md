MED/CMD on the behold screen is sure to elicit a Bateman-esque 'Oooo', but the power lets Troi down big time. An early game gauntlet option thanks to a good skill set and a few 45% trait combos, Troi should help you navigate that part of the game for a while, but she hits like a wiffle bat compared to many Legendary options. Her best bet for behold reprieve will come when her classic Troi trait bag of Counselor, Empath, and Betazoid get some collection love from WRG.
