You can almost hear de Lancie exclaiming, “How ‘bout a big hug!” It might be best to save your hugs for more worthy crew.

The areas of interest here are the standard event/collection combo that just about every legendary in the game has at this point. Without many goodies in his gauntlet, voyage, or arena baskets, it’s mostly a mishmash of variant and trait events a few times per year to look forward to while he moonlights as a daily shuttle pilot.

Spawning as a four-out-of-five giveaway makes this Q a tempting citation target, but he offers nothing that other crew couldn’t match and his mostly subpar daily offerings are a disappointment for a new release.
