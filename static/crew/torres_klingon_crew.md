Not exactly what you'd call daily use crew, Klingon Torres is a theoretically great event purple shackled to a character that has yet to yield consistent events. Trait megas have buoyed an event count that's otherwise pretty poor, so expect inconsistency and usage in chunks when it comes. I'll leave you to decide if it was intentional or by accident that both this card, and her human half, the gold Human Torres, are both destined to hang out in storage. Maybe it's true that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, eh?
