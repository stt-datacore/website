Albert, or “Mack Daddy” as his friends call him (*citation pending), likes robots. They’re very efficient. Much like WRG, who have been efficiently churning out BigBase™ and upper-tier Voyager crew so much lately they seem to negate each other at every turn. Everyone’s favorite Irishman is naturally both of these things. 

Let’s start with that BigBase™. Mack Attack remains solidly in the upper reaches of SCI Bases despite losing his crown. As we here at the BigBook like to remind folks, there are only so many Seats on a Voyage and Shuttles can only get so difficult. He may have by far the top O’Brien variant SCI Base (as there’s only two of them), but it’s otherwise the law of diminishing returns. Don’t let this negativity diminish your opinion of Big Mack, however, as he should be good for a few Events a year where Base is king. 

Not just a one-trick pony, Mack the Knife debuts at or near the top of his Voyage triplet and Skill order, finding a place alongside former Mega Event Recurring Legendaries and even the mythical Voyage Exclusive Admiral Black. Elderly rosters in search of the elusive 14 Hour Natural will find that he offers small bumps up across a few Antimatter seats, and newer accounts looking to maybe spring for the ÜberKampaign can add a quick new punch to their roster. 

Unfortunately, much like his on-screen persona, ol’ Mack and Cheese falls a bit flat otherwise. Until WRG gives us the Far Beyond The Stars Collection (no, dear reader, I will not stop talking about this til it happens), we will have to be happy with his spot in its surrogate, “Story Time”, as well as three other Stat-Boosting ones. So sit back with a pipe, look for your matches, and wait til the next Campaign, Giveaway, or Mega Event Recurring Legendary takes his place.
