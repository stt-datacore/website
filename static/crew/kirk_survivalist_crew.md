True to his on-screen performance, this Kirk has cobbled together every useful part of a card and created a cannon of a crew. Collection? Check. Multiple ranked Gauntlet pairs, strong skirmish ability, above average voyage power? Check, check, check. The crafty Kirk has picked the perfect character to be a proficiency crew for because he's the only variant with SCI and was only recently passed over for best Kirk ENG. Which means that, barring other featured characters, he'll have a ~400 ENG and ~900 SCI lead over the best non-bonus options for Kirk event shuttles. Great news, since over 80% of Kirk's events have included shuttles. If you want to collect crew from each character and have your bases covered (pardon the pun) for events, Survivalist Kirk is the easiest choice you can make.
