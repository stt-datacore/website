There's some intermittent event usage here, but you're taking Martok because he's a one stop collection shop. Veteran players will gobble him up at the behold screen as a cure for their collection ills and though ticking three notches at once is fantastic for players at every level, some younger rosters may want more daily versatility. Either way, don't go too long without collecting stars for him, even if you wait a while to fulfill a build cost replete with faction items.
