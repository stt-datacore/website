Red's mega welcoming party went something like "Uuggghh another CMD/DIP/SEC?" and his daily work has predictably not been great since then, but as we navigate WRG's collection fun house, Thrax's rather alluring trait set may be his redemption arc. Seven non-HFS traits is a bounty and while they've not yet paid off on the weekend, many of them are not so large that they can't catch bonuses, especially as a sidecar to a new collection.

The only quantifiable, daily use attribute worth discussing at this point is his usable SEC proficiency. Maybe new players get some one star use out of that (along with his SEC/Investigator node unlock in the Celestial Temple), but with so much skill set competition and a lack of 45%+ crit gauntlets, Thrax won't hold up in that area as your roster grows.
