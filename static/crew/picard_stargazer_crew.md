I'm conflicted on Stargazer Picard. On one hand, he's a very good card for new players wanting someone to have a strong card to start with. His DIP is pretty good for a common card but his SCI is poor. His one major drawback is that you can only get him from the honor hall for 1500 honor, this is better spent on trainers in the early game. Picard is featured is quite a lot of events but this versions stats are nowhere near competitive. A side note is that he is the #1 common Voyager, so he might make it on one of your first two hour voyages. If you have him you really have no choice but to immortalise him, otherwise it's a waste of honor. Not worth spending on and nothing amazing gained by immortalising him.
