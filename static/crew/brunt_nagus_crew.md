Lord Brunt, formerly of the FCA, has come to audit your collections and has found them wanting. Luckily, you've found the cure for what ails you and we're not talking about boiled Tube Grub extract. The Diplomat collection has grown to include dozens of crew and with most of them being higher rarity, Brunt will be one of several slum dunk low-rarity crew whose immortalization is a mere formality. He's also one of two options you can finish to hit the five crew collection threshold for Ferengi.

Unfortunately his daily work in the early game is minimal at best. The alien Brunt qualifies for Sunday cadet missions (the lobes are a dead giveaway), but only his DIP is suitable for Epic difficulty and won't make much of an impact elsewhere. If you've not run many Ferengi shuttles, you'll be at the mercy of your replicator to finish a build cost that includes fistfuls of Faction items, including over thirty Ferengi trade by-laws. What can we say? The guy knows his profits.
