The headliner for FTP is fusion fodder - a "new age Mobile Doctor". Resulting in one of the strongest crew in the game, Spock's fusion with Anxious Kirk is significant value for this card and will generally be his best use going forward, assuming you can get your hands on his super rare counterpart. But how does he pan out on his other merits?

A Splash of MED isn't just a best seller at the Jamba Juice in your mall's food court, it's also been used to perk up the value of many a voyager in Timelines. Unfortunately that's not a big factor for FTP Spocko who sits in the double digit voyage ranks for his own skill set behind many recent names like Century Nurse Crusher, Wyatt Miller, Caldos IV Crusher, Leila Kalomi, or even mega crew like Qod, and Soji Asha.

Typically we don't shotgun a bunch of comps for a crew, especially lesser known names, but the point is that even though "MED = rare" has been making its rounds for years now, that's not entirely true for this skill set. Spock will be a serviceable voyager on many rosters, but his skill set is not particularly rare and his power is average at best.

The meat of many Spocks' value lies in events. The Spock Empire is featured fairly frequently and his variants always have a bevy of plus traits, including Vulcan which sits behind only Discovery for most event bonuses to date. Tack on a collection that still requires a half dozen legendary crew to finish and FTP has a handful of angles to contribute from as a standalone card.
