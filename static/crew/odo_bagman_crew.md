The Bagman and his fellow Bada-philes have some nebulous, hard to quantify value attached thanks to their spots in a collection that rewards a pretty good legendary crew upon completion. While most veteran players will want him solely on that basis, how does he perform for newer players?

Luckily, Odo can contribute from star one thanks to some hefty gauntlet rolls. Debuting top 20 in total proficiency between some long time names like Revolutionary Damar and Seven of Nine is thus far unheard of for super rare crew. Unfortunately his skill set lets him down, as it has for hundreds of other crew.

Despite a couple of ranked pairs and a 45% crit trait set (MED featured), there's simply too much skill pair competition for Odo to be a viable asset long-term. So while he's great for new players to snag if possible, bad voyage metrics and lousy bases lock away the rest of his value behind immortalization. At minimum, Bagman is an interesting crew with something to offer for everyone, but getting there may be a series of peaks and valleys.
