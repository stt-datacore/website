The Kukalaka waits...silently stalking your chronitons, ready to strike. This Bashir has a build cost reputation, but the bigger issue is that he doesn't pay it off. Statistically weak in all areas of the game, he, like a handful of others, is saved by his MED-centric skill set and brand name. Ugly bases should chip on from higher star counts for a few shuttles each year and he has an outside shot at MED/CMD voyages for those in dire straits. Gauntlet work for newer players is available as a one star investment against other poor behold choices.
