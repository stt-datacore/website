Following in the footsteps of Gaffe of the Year finalist EDF Adira's came the safe choice from WRG; an upgraded version in the form of a giveaway. Point for point, Adira Tal is an upgrade on their predecessor - Pri/sec/tri bases, voyage score, voyage skill set, anti-matter traits, the list goes on. Luckily it's not an either/or situation and the two compliment each other, but this redux version shines brightly on their own.
