As far as launch cards go, it's a 'mild shock' :O that Wes still has some fringe benefits. His arena evasion activates quickly enough and lasts long enough for most situations while his SCI/Prodigy combination can unlock a handful of nodes on the galaxy screen. Good for just one or two events yearly, his only real shot to improve in value would be his non-HFS traits hitting on a collection.
