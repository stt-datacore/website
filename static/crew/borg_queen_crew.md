Today's obligatory Mega reputation reset reminder (what a mouthful) has been brought to you by the Big Book. You might not know the Queen is almost three years old, thanks to the wonderful flesh-stretching sessions afforded her, but her base dropping out of the top 20 ranks and voyage out of the top 100 is something to keep in mind amidst the many 'rock-solid' testimonials praising this crew.

That being said, she's still worthwhile, despite her age. Somehow the seeming one-off character has collected a handful of mega events with room for more, especially if ST:Picard buoys Borg again, so you can easily still justify taking her for purely aesthetic or nostalgia reasons, and not feel that bad about it. It may not be 2017 anymore, but Alice is still turning back the clock.
