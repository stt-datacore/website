The second most influential Lucille in Trek history is nowhere near the Goat's level of power as a collection reward, but has carved out a few areas of value for herself. Janeway events will never go out of style and her event history is punctuated by giant spike years that contain more weekend work than some characters have had in Timelines' entire run.

The other half of her value profile (aside from being "free"*) consists of her pair of collections which may be joined by Romantic some day. She's not a bad door prize if you're entering the wonderful world of collections, but not particularly a name to chase at the end of the Holodeck Enthusiasts collection.

*Buy five get one free is not free. Packs are a scam. Birds are secret government surveillance drones. Captain Idol was Deep Throat.
