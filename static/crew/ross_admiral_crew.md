A fan favourite among Starfleet admirals, Ross is, by all accounts, better than he should be, with +1 Diplomat, a zippy 6s +7 Attack boost, and a relatively painless equip softening the blow when you inevitably freeze him. With the bulk of his traits being wholly non-eventable, he may be looking at a Cultural Figure mega as his one chance to be thawed once displaced from daily shuttles.
