Luau Ash's usage flipped almost overnight, going from event monster and strong voyage crew to now collection fodder. Disco days of yore may never again pluck him from cryostasis, although a handful of other traits including Klingon will pop from time to time alongside scattered Tyler events. And while his voyage ranking is still good for a super rare, the skill set is many times more crowded than any other, ensuring that if other purples can't pip him, legendary crew certainly will.

Tyler's essential Klingon tag and accompanying collection should have more players picking him up than before, but his other attributes have been relegated to bit players for most rosters.
