Giveaway crew are always tempting to cite for the perceived honor save in not needing four citations, but if you make that choice with this Picard, don't do it for his work on voyages. CMD/DIP/SCI has been printed en masse as the new CMD/DIP/SEC and with debut voyage power hanging out among even launch day cards, his shelf life in that area is short lived.

Elsewhere, however, he's not bad. Picard has always lacked a strong CMD base, which is a role.....model..... that CPDP fills nicely. His body of traits affords him two spots in collections which have been expanded and are likely to be again in the future, while supplementing weekend event bonuses. Not a complete package, but a fine 'toolbox' crew for many rosters and situationally worth the last-star-giveaway-tax.
