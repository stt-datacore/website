To boil things down to brass tacks, just as Patar would want it, this card has strong voyage and base metrics with a collection attached. A galaxy event was the right place to debut her and new players will benefit most from her four copies, while established rosters will take the perfunctory notch on the Vulcan collection for their weekend efforts.
