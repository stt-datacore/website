I am the very model of a modern WRG six pack ephemeral,
I've skillsets bloated, overstuffed, and terrible,
I know my stats are serviceable, and I quote event counts historical,
From Discovery to Strange New Worlds, in order categorical;
I'm very well acquainted, too, with traits unoriginal,
I understand the skeptics, both the simple and the knowledgeable,
But I'm better than I look and there are worse cards to bank,
Hmm . . . bank, bank . . . aha!
Raw power like this is something you'll want filling up your tank!
