He's got one skill - no one should be surprised at discovering he's a bad card, but he's certainly not the worst card. He has a few notable offerings while some cards can't even claim one good attribute. Scotty's primarily an arena and Skirmish asset who hits the trifecta of strong boost (+9 accuracy), fast activation (4 sec), and the best passive stats in the game. Heaps and oodles of crit, accuracy, and evasion make him formidable there, even with a single star. Much like gauntleteers, if you want to snag one copy of him to boost your Skirmish game, that value beats out a handful of other deadbeats.
