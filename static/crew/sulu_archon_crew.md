Full marks to Sulu for picking up a collection spot (it automatically makes him, like, his third best variant), but that DIP base is as empty calories as it gets. Flipping through the pages of Sulu's event profile we see an off-the-wall Pilot mega, potentially eating up his most eventable trait, and the ugly, stock-standard trait set of Human/Starfleet/Federation which are simply stat-padders.

Sulu's first event feature didn't provide a bonus for variants while his second was supposed to, but was bugged. Which made 2021 the first time long-suffering Takei fans got any relief over a six year stretch. Thin event/collection value automatically puts him ahead of several dud cards, but that's as ringing of an endorsement as we can muster.
