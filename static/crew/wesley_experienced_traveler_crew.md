After years moving around the Irish countryside in his caravan, trading horses and raising lurchers, Experienced Traveler Wesley returned to the franchise in style, claiming credit on behalf of his organisation for the Supervisor shenanigans we had seen unfold. Many fingers in many pies, apparently.

These years of wandering have really grown (no longer young) Wesley, both as a man and as a Timelines character. A much needed power boost for the name, he joins us as by far the best variant in game. Rising to the top echelons of his Triplet, he should find use on even Elderly rosters, especially given his wide set of popular AM Bonus seating traits. These traits also bring with them Four Stat-Boosting Collections, which you know we here the Big Book consider “a good start”. Shuttle usage will be limited to Faction Events, where he is a solid performer in many of his traits’ skill combinations. He won’t Gauntlet or Ship Battle for you, but then that was never Wesley’s style anyway, was it? Go ahead and grab a copy when the opportunity presents itself to you, be it in Event rewards, a BeGold, or perhaps outside of a library after you’ve just finished deleting a bunch of your dad’s work.
