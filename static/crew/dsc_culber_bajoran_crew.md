A heap of collection value alone makes Culber's first super rare variant an easy choice from anywhere you can get your hands on him. In addition, worthwhile voyage capability for newer players and Culber's only DIP option for event shuttles has him running the value gamut and offers something for every roster.

Whether it's a Bajoran collection, an uptick in Culber event features post-Disco megas, or an expansion of the Physician collection, it's not hard to envision Culbs' value staying afloat for a long time.
