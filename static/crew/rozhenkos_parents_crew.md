Between the somewhat threatening Arena Ability name and shadowy shading on their art, you could be excused for thinking they're Russian mafia. And if mama's Rokeg blood pie doesn't kill you, the Rozhenko's Stats just might.

The only consideration here is Traits, both for Collections and Events. Offering very little value in either area as of this writing, we're going to need to see their Traits blossom further before they're worth the Behold capital. Until then, these two are better left pestering Chief O'Brien about the Enterprise specs and diagrams.
