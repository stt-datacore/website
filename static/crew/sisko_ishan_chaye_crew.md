Not Avery Brook’s most memorable outing, but this is definitely a card worth travelling through a changeling-induced fever dream to get. Being among the ENG elite on voyages is a big move for an obscure character but, ambiguity aside, his numbers do show his versatility. Second only to global giveaway Adira Tal for ENG/DIP voyages, he perfectly complements them and other familiar names with DIP primaries like Bridge Officer No.1, Interfaced La Forge, and Stranded Quark.

Ample bases give him top billing for DIP and ENG seats during Sisko events while an assortment of traits all but guarantee him a few extra whacks at the Faction piñata. Six second arena evasion is the royal icing on top of a crew who will churn out work on your roster for years to come.
