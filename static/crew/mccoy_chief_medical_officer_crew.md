The original Mr. Blue is a perfunctory immortalize for his collections, but a fairly simple one at least. A cheap build, at least compared to other rarities, you may be tempted to level Bones up early, but while his large combined score can help out with cadet missions and sundry galaxy map node unlocks, your gold trainers are generally better used on event purples and stronger overall crew.
