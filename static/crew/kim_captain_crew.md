He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again. And now his watch is ended. Didn't think a broke nacelle could kill a man.

Prisoner Kim ripped the headlines from Captain Kim's aged fingers, but for a while there (precisely 18 months) this was the best Kim variant by about twelve parsecs. Dubbed as 'Braxton Jr.' early on for skill set considerations, Kim is another lesson in why voyage ranks matter and that 'close enough' doesn't always stay close enough.

With daily use ability in its twilight, Kim can at least boast an impressive (if confusing) event history that has seen multiple variant features in every year but one and a pair of traits in Musician and Explorer that have felt like locks to get some collection and event love for a long time. As his stats approach the age of his art, Kim has gone from a card who brings home the bacon to one that saves your bacon in bad beholds.
