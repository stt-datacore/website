This note originally only said “It’s Combs, baby!”, but we’ve let that writer go. Perhaps the least well known of Jeffrey Combs’ many faces, this scoundrel is missing out on regular events or collections, but offers respectable overall utilIty. Between a 200% instant damage attack and a top ten ENG base, he certainly has the stats to justify daily use, though older rosters may find themselves freezing him sooner rather than later. If he’s lucky, one of his fanny-pack’s worth of traits will end up being the next surprise mega theme. Otherwise - that’s Tsunkatse, baby.
