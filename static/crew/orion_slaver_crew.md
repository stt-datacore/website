I didn't mean to say that Orion Slaver should be hauling garbage. I meant to say that he should be hauled away as garbage.

Big Show has a pair of event features, but unless your account is only a couple months old when you stumble into three or four stars that way, Slaver is not going to make an impact. Like a lot of power creeped crew, he's at the mercy of his traits for future collection and event opportunities.
