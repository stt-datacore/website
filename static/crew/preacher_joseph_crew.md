“Oh, that my words were now written. Oh, that they were printed in a BigBook. Write those words, Brother BB. Let them see the glory of what lies ahead.”

Finally leaping from the hallucinations of a grieving and conflicted Captain Sisko and into Star Trek Timelines is everyone’s favourite unnamed 20th Century Preacher played by Brock Peters! Sadly, the wait has not been worth it, as he’s a largely DOA Super Rare Skillet. No Voyage, no Gauntlet, no Ship Battle viability…no point dwelling on it.

Don’t despair, for younger accounts (or Purple Only alts) can find use in his DIP base for daily shuttle work or perhaps when the odd trait triggers for a Faction Event. Speaking of traits, he does have a place in two Stat-Boosting Collections with a chance at three more (also, seriously WRG, Far Beyond the Stars when?!?!), so he could grab some nice retroactive value down the line. Go now and write the truth that's in your heart. The truth that shall set them free! Praise be the word of the BigBook. Praise to the word of the BB Authors.
