Typically, non-event 2-skill crew are stuffed somewhere near the bottom of the list. But Pulaski's yuuuge DIP is the single highest base stat of all Super Rare crew and higher than the primary of over a dozen FF legendary crew. She'll be a shuttle anchor even going into the late game until 4/5s and better replace her. +1 Physician and fantastic card art.
