I guess nobody told Georgy Girl that this is a marathon, not a sprint. She shot out in the lead to become the second legendary crew in three stat-boosting collections, but her viable traits are now all tapped out, as are her best chances at event work.

With Disco megas likely finished and her Section 31 show on ice, Georgiou is going to struggle for weekend relevance. Her shuttle-friendly bases will have no trouble earning a seat when she finds a bonus, but how often that occurs is highly questionable going forward. She's still worth a shot in low-end beholds, but her special attraction has been dwarfed by the Disney-sized Collection Theme Park that opened right next door.
