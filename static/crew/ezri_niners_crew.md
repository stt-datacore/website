I'll level with you, there are times when I almost want to downplay how good a card is because I want to try and game the system, get fewer people to compete in events, just so I can have a better shot at them. I've never done it, but boy have I been tempted. And Ezri is the latest in a very small line to tempt me.

Boasting enough raw voyage power to hold serve with top names, Ezri sprinkles in plenty of tasty little fringe benefits along the way. For one, she's one of the few top shelf voyagers that you'll actually recognise at a glance (Leucon? Boothby Replicant?), meaning she grandfathers her way into a Dax-sized event count. So far, so Fancy, Dan.

Ezri also manages to slide into home plate with the crown of #1 Dax SEC (stolen from the withering Mirror Jadzia), meaning she corners the market on some of the more common shuttle seats. She also comes bundled with a useable +9 Attack at six seconds on ships, and a hard to complete vanity collection with some truly despicable cards that you don't want to immortalise before her.

She does have her downsides - mediocre traits outside of Athlete, Counselor, and Costumed - and she's still a SEC/DIP voyager at the heart of things, her MED only a third skill - but numbers like these age like a fine wine, not unlike Nicole de Boer herself. So snag yourself a copy while you can, and enjoy some Scotch gum.
