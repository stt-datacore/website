His build is on the tricky side, requiring a dozen super rare components and myriad faction items and science experiments, but he eventually pays it off through Kirk events, a couple eventable traits, and some collection value. His arena ability might be in some players' rotation if not for Ardra's existence, but you can make do with him in a pinch. Given his low utility in areas of daily use, don't feel bad about de-prioritizing this Kirk and picking him up at a later date.
