Trelane's alter ego is all business this time around. His voyage metrics are excellent and don't need any nitpicking, common skill set or not. He even has a puncher's chance in the gauntlet despite a middling ranked pair, because of the Dahar Master crit trait which he only has to share with two other crew. The raw gauntlet numbers don't allow him the dominance he enjoys elsewhere, but in combination with a half dozen 45-65% trait sets do offer a bit of extra value to an otherwise strong card.

Three holes of varying sizes in his game are an unappealing arena offering, the most replaceable skill set, and limited event chances. Koloth's traits have combined for a respectable event count thus far, but consist of pretty much Klingon weekends so far. It's unlikely that his event rate will continue going forward, but he'll knock it out of the park every once in a while with a SEC base ranked highly across his trait pool, which should be at full power provided you take him to max for his spot in two different stat-boosting collections.
