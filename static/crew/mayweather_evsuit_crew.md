I think he was crew #1000 or something, right? Mayweather's always gotten the short end of the stick across writing rooms and mediums, but at least good ol' power creep presents a version of Travis with some intermediate value.

Usable voyage power vs poor skill set has long been the Dragonball Z analog of Prophet Kira vs Pah-Wraith Jake. Who wins that fight depends on your roster construction and how hard you've been veering toward or away from extremely common constructs like CMD/DIP/SEC or CMD/DIP/SCI. This Mayweather has some voyage juice for a while longer, but even a lower ranked option like Mountain Climber Mayweather will often produce better results thanks to a less recurrent skill combo.

His fairly thin trait set somewhat limits Mayweather's future event and collection potential - help sorely needed for an infrequent event name. But a collection in hand is worth two in the bush and EV Suit's advent + expansion in short order should provide value in a varying amount based on the number of legendary crew needed for the final threshold.
