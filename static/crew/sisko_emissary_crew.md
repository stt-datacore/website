The Sisko is of Tier 2, but he will find no peace there.

Debuting with a Bajoran spirit bomb of a voyage rank, the Emissary may sport a somewhat tired skill set - surely suplexing Pah-Wraith possessed Dukat into the Fire Caves deserves a little more than a SEC tertiary? - but the power, the AM traits, and the relatively unique skill order all guarantee a long life on voyages. Taking a peek at his voyage seating, he has no direct superior on any of his seven potential seats, and considering just how tricky it can be to lock down a good Bajoran, Cultural Figure or Inspiring voyager, he's going to remain the de facto choice for all of them for the foreseeable future. Other cards like Surrogate Kira or Gary Seven will eat a small slice of his non-linear cake thanks to their superior skill sets, but even if you were to run both, the chances are still incredibly favourable that you'll find a place for him anyway.

Elsewhere, his serviceable but hardly unique DIP base will find ample work in Sisko events, which have generally averaged at least two a year with the exception of 2022 - and even that year, somewhat loosely applied character specific traits like Cultural Figure kept most of his variants busy enough that you're guaranteed to see a return on your investment when it comes to shuttle schleps. His ship ability works on just slow enough of a cycle that he would be classified as useable but not necessarily 'meta' for boss battles, acting as a decent fill in if current favourites like Laborer Kirk or Dereth have yet to make an appearance on your roster.  Granted, both of those cards have better art, too, but let's try not to be too salty about the apotheosis of Sisko's character arc being immortalised in game with the worst combadge sketched by a living hand since my first attempt back in 1998 . . .

Finally, collections - because you were going to ask. The profile is rosy, with all three of his non-HFS traits looking viable if not downright likely, but he lacks some of the more flavourful Sisko character traits like Chef to give him a chance at some oddball value down the road - he's plainly good, especially since he'll save you from having to immortalise a Lincoln or a Layna for the rather big collections he's joining, but just a smidge off elite. In the end, the Sisko is, as of time of writing, of Tier 2, but he will find no peace there. The skill order may be a welcome refresh of cards like Xindi Insectoid, the power and event profile are there, and the traits are good, but especially at the rate of power creep we're seeing lately, it's easy to see him being pipped in key areas relatively quickly, rendering him as merely good rather than the elite he is right now - so make your peace with what he leaves behind when that happens.
