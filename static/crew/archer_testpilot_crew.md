Repurposed launch day art sadly dovetails with statistical usability that looks to match it. Outside of Archer events, the lack of which WRG/DB did finally begin to rectify, thereâ€™s not much meat on the bone. Jon will need a few lucky collection traits to hit and probably a show collection to boot before he begins to approach the appeal of dozens, if not hundreds of other Super Rares. Without much daily use or niche value, this is a catch and release.
