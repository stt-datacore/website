Zo "Essence of the Male" bral is probably an anagram for 'bravado' in somebody's dictionary, but does his bite back up his bark? There's no point in burying the lede this time, only three crew in the game package faster instant damage with +10 attack on ships and you may have heard of them - Captain Killy, Fury Kes, and Rura Penthe Commandant. Zobral's a hair slower, but if someone were authoring a Big Book of Arena Advice, he would slot nicely into tier 2.

The rest of the card is window dressing. Heâ€™s no longer a voyager (if he ever was) thanks to an onerous skill set. If MED/CMD/ENG is the Ferrari of skill combos, CMD/DIP/SEC is like trying to merge onto the highway in a Hot Wheels. Even with better power, these sorts of crew are replaced so often, they may as well have "Made in Ferenginar" stamped on the back.

A pair of Braxton-esque 1-2 proficiencies are again blunted by a skill set far more competitive than CMD/ENG and in the absence of some applicable traits like Desperate to grant him more 45% crit sets, he has a hard-capped, new player ceiling. Zobral's prolific actor may have a following who'd be happy to employ him on their roster and his arena bona fides can at least ensure that while we wait for an above average collection profile to turn more from potential into actual.
