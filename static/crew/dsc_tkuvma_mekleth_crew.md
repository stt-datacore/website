The former Mega crew for years had tormented arena-goers, but as Skirmishes and certain new crew have pushed players toward faster burst damage, T'kuvma has gone from terror to liability in most circumstances. His 375% chunk of damage at 10 seconds is certainly great for new players and can help shorten Skirmish battles. But with the advent of crew retrieval and a growing number of 6-8 second burst crew, T'kuvma may end up as an expensive paperweight in the arena.

Outside of ship battles, he's most likely to find work in trait events, or as a gauntlet fifth during one of this trio of 45% gauntlets. With few reasons in favor of immortalizing, his spot in the Klingon collection will be worn better by competent voyage or event crew.
