The rare reward for a mission in Episode 10 (don't forget to ad warp!), Quinn (still) offers some respectable base and voyage power. His event future is difficult to forecast reliably with no variants and a trait set eclectic enough to make an interior decorator blush, but with daily use ability and some intriguing collection potential, he might not need them.

His availability makes him a fascinating study into citations. Though the pitfalls of CMD/DIP/SEC one-off crew are very well documented, he's also offers reasonable power and beams himself and an ad-warped copy onto your ship for free. If you're the morality play sort of Trek fan, you could do worse than the man who gave us all a peek behind the Qurtain.
