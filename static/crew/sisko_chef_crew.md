Okay first, yes that is a Potato, a coffee fueled Potato no less!. We’re going to laugh about this potato and how strange it is to equip for some time. #3 DIP base combined with a #13 MED base is very respectable for someone poking a vegetable. His Cultural Figure trait will unlock some specific nodes and might get an antimatter boost in voyages. His dual collection bonus is nice but his DIP proficiency isn’t that wide and he can’t work on any cadet missions. If it’s DIP/MED voyages you are looking to fill then Deanna Troi might be a better example.
