This former Mega crew had tormented arena-goers for years, but as fast-hitting Skirmishes and limitless FBB options have shaped the meta, T'kuvma has gone from terror to liability in most circumstances. His chunk of damage coming online at 10 seconds is certainly usable for new players and can help shorten Skirmish battles, but with the advent of crew retrieval and a growing number of 6-8 second burst crew, T'kuvma may end up as an expensive paperweight as your roster grows.

Outside of ship battles, he's most likely to find work in trait events or as a gauntlet fifth during one of his quartet of 45% gauntlets. With few reasons in favor of immortalizing, Kuvy’s collection value may only be realized after a series of ‘best of the rest’ behold choices.
