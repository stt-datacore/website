Nanoprobe does well for himself with a strong skill order/trait combo to pump up several different parts of his game. As an Honor Hall crew and without much gauntlet or arena prowess, you're looking at a five-star investment with the first star costing a hefty sum. Does he pay it off? I don't know, I'm just an author.

Boasting a great skill order for voyages, Phlox's ENG/MED is one of the more coveted skill combos in the game. Even as his relative power there drops, he can perform in a few niche places long after many other crew would have fallen out of service. His above average trait lineup gives him a handful of anti-matter seats there along with a few collections, which is always nice to have in an Honor Hall crew that you can purchase at any time to finish one or more collection thresholds.

Despite ENG not receiving much love for Faction event seating, Nanoprobe debuted as the top option in that skill for every one of his traits, which have significantly boosted an otherwise disappointing event résumé for the Phlox character. Until he receives more competition for those precious few ENG and MED seats, he should be able to find more shuttle work than you'd think for a character who's still lagging behind in event opportunities like most ENT characters.
