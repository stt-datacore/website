Decoy's voyage skill set and general lack of daily use are huge pills to choke down, but bubbling just under the surface are a rock solid event history (think corundum, not shale. Shout out to Mr. B, my 8th grade geo teacher) and event value that could blow away the perception put forth by her mere four traits.

Lacking the dreaded Human/Fed/Starfleet set, any of her traits are viable for collections and perhaps her best offering is not even among them. Bada-bing, Bada-Goatman O'Brien is a worthwhile collection for the foreseeable future, rewarding a tremendous voyage/base crew in Scapegoat and requiring far fewer immortalized golds to reach him than your standard stat-boosting thresholds. If you work around Decoy's deficiencies and utilize her strengths, she's a fine crew to behold or even cite as a path toward stronger crew.
