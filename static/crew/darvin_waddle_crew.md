There's a lot to like about Barry, and it starts with his art which exudes strong Fonzie energy. While his outward appearance may be misleading (how did trained Starfleet officers fall for it twice?!?), he's easily the best mega recurring in more than a year. His skill set is both rare and excellent, and his power level is great. He debuts as only the second card with his skill order, the other being Prisoner Kim who has similar voyage oomph. 

It's unlikely Barry will ever see variant events, but his trait mix is pretty good for both voyage antimatter bonuses and trait bonus events. He's +1 Klingon to boot, so with that kind of collection value on top of his voyage credentials, he absolutely deserves to be 5/5 on almost any roster. Barry even has some fringe gauntlet use, and is likely to be putting in work for years even as vanilla skill set mega cards are crowded out.
