Who? Tau Ceti? Tau Cannon? I think he's that guy from the one episode where-- oh who cares, what collections does he have?

If you just HAVE to have Tau for his role in everybody's favorite *checks notes* Voyager episode in which Janeway hang glides with Gimli while wearing a dress, then you'll be glad to know that his least likely collection trait was the first to hit and surely won't be his last. There is more non-collection use here than you might think from a hard-to-place name and he should qualify for thawing during a handful of trait events in the future as well. Not notably elite, but likely to increased in value over time.
