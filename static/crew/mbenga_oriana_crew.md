All those who wander, are in fact a bit lost, and then they get found and piggy-backed out of harm’s way. This is, perhaps, an overly simplistic summary of the scene in which we find ourselves with this unfortunately unflattering art (I know her face was dirty, but come on!), however we just don’t have time to delve into how M’Benga’s experiences with his own daughter clearly drive an extraordinary fatherly response to Oriana’s plight in this episode.

Brilliant Trek writing aside, this version of Joseph “Cheek Bones” M’Benga is a bit of a one-hit-wonder, but for some of you out there this may be all the hit you need. He/they are quite simply one of the best MED/all-around Voyagers you can find if you aren’t dipping into the Legendary ranks, and that alone earns this non-fusion “pairing” a strong place on any earlier-game roster looking for a boost in that game aspect. If you’re not a Nightmare Mode player, however, the only long term use you’ll find here is a healthy four Stat-Boosting Collections with a shot at earning at least one more, which is far from the worst investment you can make in a Super Rare.
