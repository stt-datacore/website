We're living in a world where we have to admit that Lonzak is great crew. Just aim the death ray at me right now. Besides the obvious base and voyage numbers that spell out good daily capability, he's got a half dozen relevant traits for boosting voyage anti-matter and event chances. A year from now, this note may detail Lonzak's triumphs in the Villian and Romantic megas. If you're a collection or nostalgia chaser looking to tick the vanity collection boxes, Lonzak is one of the better places to start.
