Good ol' Miles has a sterling reputation, and even with his voyage numbers finally hitting the point of obscurity, there's still a lot to recommend (and a lot to like) about this mid-2016 card. Jury Rigger no longer requires anywhere near the investment it used to, but in an era of expanding collections and all kinds of cards regaining relevance, it's not a bad bonus to pick up, and he's definitely still one of the more desirable cards in Holodeck Enthusiasts (Bridge to Ensign Kim, Ensign Kim, your sword is drooping).

The #1 O'Brien ENG and CMD bases still count for something, even if the Chief's events only ever clock in at a respectable two per year, and as befitting someone with pilot wings as shiny as his, the Hero trait still feels like a dark horse for a potential mega once WRG gets all the other pesky 'what kind of a link is THAT?' themes we've had recently. Fittingly, perhaps the ultimate wingman - you'll never be unhappy to see him in a begold.
