Troi has consistently had strong and/or interesting card releases - Nepenthe is more of the latter. She doesn’t hit any of the high notes like Durango’s SEC or Mintakan’s traits and generally disappoints where power is concerned, but can fill spot roles thanks to her skill set and traits.

A few highlights include a reasonable event history and level of collection potential, both of which are fed into by her traits. With a few of them like Betazoid and counselor flying under the radar, she has a theoretical value level that might exceed a cursory assessment. 

Nepenthe’s also found a nice niche in the gauntlet, thanks to her MED and CMD skill set. A quartet of 45% gauntlets should be enough for her to realize those values without too long of a drought between them and she owns the featured skill in three of the four.

Troi’s surface level power is certainly flagging at best, but there’s value there for many rosters and, hell, it was just great to see her back on our TVs.
