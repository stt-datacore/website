He can move some hot Rolexes, but he’s not capable of helping out your roster very much. Sulu’s averaging a fraction of an event per year and has already tapped into what was likely his first, last, and only eventable trait. With lacklustre metrics at every turn, the best that can be said of him is about his cheap cost to equip for collectors.
