{"id":392,"symbol":"event_hvge_basketballblitz","name":"Basketball Blitz","description":"The galaxy's first basketball tournament is underway! However, the galaxy where time has gone awry never rests and your help is needed to ensure the event concludes without incident!","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In this Hybrid Event, you will complete Voyages in one phase, and Supply Missions in another phase.\n-- In the Voyage Phase, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- Gold and Silver skills for the Voyage Phase will be CMD and DIP. \n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using any version of Tucker, Sato, Bokai, or Athletes will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points during the Voyage Phase, as well as bonus to Supply Missions during the Galaxy Phase.\n-- Using the NX-02 Columbia, the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, or the NX-Class Ship will provide a bonus to antimatter during the Voyage Phase.\n-- Using ships with the Pioneer trait will provide a bonus to antimatter during the Voyage Phase.\n-- In the Voyage Phase you earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- In the Galaxy Phase every Supply Mission you complete earns you Event Victory Points. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- Community Rewards are also available during Phase 2 only. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock these rewards before the phase change!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Tucker, Sato, Bokai, or Athletes","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_hvge_basketballblitz.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":27348,"symbol":"tpol_orpheus_crew","name":"T'Pol","full_name":"Orpheus T'Pol","flavor":"T’Pol does not consider a hybrid child dangerous.
