Trekkies who adore good ol' Doc now have a proper vessel to channel their love into. The ignorant Kyrians unwittingly gave us a couple more event chances to play with thanks to Android and several other villainous traits. The EMA promises to make good use of them with not only a fat MED base, but a SECondary that's 622 points better than the next Doc option.

As potent as that all sounds, his voyage work is even better and may rival ENG/MED as the combo that nobody talks about. There are only a handful of MED/CMD or MED/SEC voyagers and EMA is the only one to cover both (Troi is SEC/CMD, don't @ me). He's not just one of two legendaries with his skill set, he's also top five for voyage MED, MED/SEC, MED/CMD and is guaranteed a voyage seat for a long, long time until at least two handfuls of crew are added above his power level. If you were happy with Katrina Cornwell, you'll fall in love with Doctor Evil.
