Very similar to Changeling Founder (gauntlet, arena, skills), Minuet has a bit more oomph in her engine. A strong trait lineup has resulted in better collection value than her comp and grants her many more gauntlet crit sets, including a handful of 45%ers.

Without a ton of experience in a world of full Balok walls yet, it's hard to give an exact determination of her efficacy in a formerly competitive CMD/DIP matchup. As a 2-skiller, she obviously operates best with large crit values, but can often be frustrating to attack into on defense. Regardless, she's a 'sometimes' option there and strong, quick defensive option in the arena as well. 

It's possible to envision a world where she becomes a 5+ collection horse down the line, so a few speculative behold stars wouldn't go amiss if the options across from her aren't particularly appealing or are hamstrung by poor traits.
