The sages in beholds did dwell
In time portals that held them well
And with the Portal's echoing yell
Their star counts grow and value swells

And there, amid the purple cites,
Two new collections appeared that night
And with the counting of the traits
The Sages knew to adjust tier weights
The Holy Big Book led them back,
Away from crew held in six packs
Instead with lists of traits on fire,
Collection crew rose higher and higher

That'll be three frangs, please.
