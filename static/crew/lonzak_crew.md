We're living in a world where we have to admit that Lonzak is a Worthy crew. Just aim the death ray at me right now.

Coveted for his voyage prowess early on, Lonzak still has a little gas left in that tank, but is not nearly as strong of an option there any longer. Instead, traits drive up his value in other areas to keep him afloat as a fairly well rounded card.

Established rosters aren't giving him a second look in the gauntlet, but if you're new to the game, you probably should. His half dozen 45%+ crit sets come around frequently enough to give him rotational use there even if CMD/SEC is a stacked combo. And every trait except Human is in the running to add to his collection count or put his shuttle-friendly skill set to work on the weekends.
