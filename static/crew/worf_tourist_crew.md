It began with the forging of the Great Pants. Three were given to the Trouser-Elves - immortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Leggings - great tailors and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine pants were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire protection for their undercarriage.

For within these pants was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another pair of pants was made. Deep in the land of Risa, in the Fires of Mount Mogh, the Dark Lord Worf forged a master pair, and into these pants he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.
