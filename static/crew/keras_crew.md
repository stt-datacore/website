Double collections, A good base CMD among Romulans, and some usable arena EV. The Romulan mega has passed, but we've seen a standalone event for them since then and Keras is the best Romulan CMD option outside of a 4/5 Vreenak. Nicely well-rounded for a 2-skiller, though mostly desirable for his collections.
