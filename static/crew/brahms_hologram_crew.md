She might be made of photonic energy but her skills are quite impressive. Sporting a #7 SCI base and #16 ENG she will unlock a fair few nodes and has a good amount of useful traits too. Her saturday and voyage potential make up for a lack of extra collection bonus and her ship ability comes with a +800 shield regeneration. Good to pair up with Rejal or Tâ€™Pol for an extra science boost.
