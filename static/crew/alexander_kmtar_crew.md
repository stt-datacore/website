Daily usage for this member of the Sloyan Rat Pack is tenuous and generally comes down to a fortuitous voyage trait match for early-to-midgame rosters who manage to fully fuse Kâ€™mtar before other more powerful options. Once his pre-cryo usefulness to you has evaporated, he falls into the classic trait-powered, sometimes usable event option mold whose collection value will compete with your other behold options.
