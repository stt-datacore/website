The "toned down" version of Narissa, let's say, is equally unassuming in game. Her blips come in the form of thin value in the arena, traits, and a collection which should be expanded at some point, but isn't yet. On ships, an evasion handicap and boost capped at +8 is compensated for by an excellent initialization time and healthy duration. She can be a usable stopgap attack booster for players in the early game.

The most deceptive aspect of this undercover Romulan is her set of traits. Between the bloated Human/Fed/Starfleet and extremely niche Romulan-adjacent traits which are unlikely to trigger anything, the needle-movers (UO, Romulan, Brutal) are more like needles in a haystack. Though everyone would want Rizzo come collection expansion time, she's currently not an essential part of most rosters.
