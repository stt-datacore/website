The players go crazy 'bout a sharp dressed (wo)man! *Guitar Riff*

This Kira card has somewhat hit her bottom. Not 'rock bottom', more like a silty, muddy botttom? I don't know where I'm going with this. The point is, now that time has stripped her voyage ability from her, she's become a card who's unlikely to experience any significant downturns in value beyond the typical stat rank erosion.

Kira's event history has been remarkably consistent outside of a blippy 2018 and as primarily an event piece at this point, we don't need to pretend that CMD/DIP/SUCK is a detriment - quite the opposite. Ample shuttle seating on weekends in concert with a few untapped bonus traits should allow her to earn her keep or at worst demand merits to conscript her from cryo as a sort of supercharged super rare.

A pair of 45% gauntlets had allowed her niche use there in the past, but a few heavy C/D/S hitters will relegate that ability to fresh rosters only. Of more global and enduring value are her collections, both present and future. If you play the collection long game, it doesn't hurt to tie those investments to crew who are established event names that will always earn occasional work.
