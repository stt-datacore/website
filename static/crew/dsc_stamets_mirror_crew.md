What you might call the King of the Might Have Been, Mirror Stamets used to be very highly regarded in these parts, but time and missed opportunities have worn him down. Perhaps the least desirable third skill for an ENG/MED skill set combines with barren traits, a sinking voyage score, and overstuffed SCI base ranks to make him daily use crew mostly for those with an affection for his character.

His event history, which you can consult to see why he drifted at higher tier altitudes in days of yore, is stuffed with the presumably dead Discovery megas. Without strong supplemental traits, the Mirror Universe is his best conduit toward non-variant bonuses, even after two megas of its own. Mirror Stamets has a few unique identifiers to draw in (and help) newer players, but is decidedly thinner on value for established rosters.
