Just a few weeks removed from '2016 crew' territory, it's no surprise that NaQed is a daily dud. In a neat little Timelines twist, this exile from the Qontinuum still gets grandfathered into their Collection and has a handful of other viable Traits to further that value or provide you chances to thaw his usable ENG Base for the weekends.

He's not a particularly unique Event/Collection combo, but one of dozens that you'll want to Immortalize sooner or later (probably later) as you chip away at late game Stat boosts.
