With a high MED base and a good range of DIP/CMD to fall back on the Empathetic Empress here is one of the best rare cards to have. She has a few useful traits to knock out nodes and can work on all the weekend cadets, and has the best Gauntlet score for all cadets. Seeing how rare MED skills are later in the game I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if she stays in your active roster once the weekend cadet missions are finished. Just make sure you have a lot of Holoprograms and Medical Experiments stocked up as she needs a lot of them to fully equip.
