From that godawful “Star Trek in Elvish” wink/nod name to a second 2-skiller variant who looks like he belongs on page 27 of a men’s fashion magazine, Elnor is not exactly burning things up in our little corner of Trekdom. 

The B I G B A S E crowd will be happy to see another DIP option for the *checks notes* 2018 Romulan mega, but jokes aside, how Elnor’s traits break in the future are going to determine whether this card sinks or swims. Obviously thawable bases have had scant opportunities to shine based on his past bonus tally, but at least most of his traits have a puncher’s chance to be featured (again) moving forward.

They also comprise what could end up as the bulk of his value over time; collections. Elnor debuts to what we hope is his all-time lowest value there - only one of his traits has been chosen by The Claw, but the Romulan collection can be finished without him (or any legendary crew). With more than enough crew already in game to see that collection expanded and a fistful of future collection possibilities, Elnor is probably worth a hold if you’re a late game player simply anticipating collection value out of your super rares.
