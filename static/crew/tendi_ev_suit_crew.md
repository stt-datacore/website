Classic Tendi, always a look of awe and wonder on her face. There’s no way something is about to go wrong. Impossible. It doesn’t matter what deck they work on, they’re all in it together.

This variant of everyone’s favourite wide-eyed Orion makes it the full set of four Main Cast EV Suit Crew from the amazing episode ‘I, Excretus’. In fact, at time of writing she’s the ninth unique character (and second Tendi) we get from it (and that doesn’t even count the homage that is the Originals Cowpoke Boimler)! Holodeck adventures are clearly ripe for the picking over at WRG.

Tendi join us with a certified* BigBase™ as she takes her place among the crowded upper ranks of the non-FBB* reward ENG crew (*see Scotty, Demo Man for further details). For all the times BigBase™ is overhyped, this is definitely one of them. A nice to have on Shuttle Events when her traits pop off or she gets a feature, there simply aren’t enough ENG seats out there to chase D’Vana just for this when you *will* get Scotty eventually (no really you will…keep grinding those Bosses and find a more active Fleet if you have to).

Thankfully, she’s far more well-rounded than that. The best Voyager in both her top Pairing and Triplet (any skill order!) will feel right at home on even the most elderly of rosters. Meanwhile, four of her seven traits already hit for Stat-Boosting Collections (including the tricky Orion one), and she’s Animated to boot. Throw in the potential to hit on two more (or all three, if they ever get crazy and desperate enough to add “Starfleet”) and Tendi will help make everyone else around her better. She’s even a bit of a Frantic McCoy-light in Arena/FBB, coming online faster but only adding +11 instead of his +12 to your Attack boost. Simply put, she’s got something for most, and you love to see that from new crew these days. If the ÜberKampaign is ever your thing, I wouldn’t pass on this month’s.
