This poster child for British dentistry was a much more sympathetic figure in Discovery than we all initially thought. Which makes it that much more tragic to see him left high and dry by the same onslaught of mega Faction Action that made him a desirable name in the first place.

Now reduced to part time event/collection combo piece, he at least has enough possibilities flowing through his traits to keep him an occasionally enticing name with a base that can still play. If Ripper ends up reaching three, four, five traits, you'll probably end up with him on your roster regardless and be happy to employ his shuttle gun for event help a few times per year.
