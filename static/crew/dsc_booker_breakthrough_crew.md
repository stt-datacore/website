A climactic moment of diplomacy in Discovery’s finale not rewarded with the Diplomat trait during the Diplomat mega? And the beat goes on…

Booker might be more bark than bite, thanks to a lot of trait “noise”. With four of his traits very unlikely to provide collection or event value, his value in those areas are quite a bit weaker than a first glance would intimate. And his voyage total debuts where big brother Sanctuary Booker’s will sit two years after his release. Unless you’re buying Gruyere, picking a pre-aged product is not a gouda idea.

His most notable attribute on release is a top X DIP base, which is infamous for its world record in Fastest Race to Irrelevance. Book certainly has some avenues for daily use, but comes out of the box looking like a crew from a few years prior, which rarely makes for a wise investment.
