In a world where WRG hasn’t released a two Skill Legendary outside of an Honor Hall crew since July 2021 (Regency Riker), Minuet was somehow once a Mega Event Recurring Legendary? I’ll take your word for it.

We at the Big Book don’t advise you to bring a skillet to Gauntlet, but if you do, be prepared to see walls of superior CMD/DIP crew you have to refresh past to find Minuet a favorite matchup. 

Minuet’s remaining game value lies in her Trait list (as with many older crew) and we can envision a world in which she tops out at a six pack of Stat-boosting Collections, so consider her a long-term investment if your Legendary Beholds show you no better options.
