If PiÃ±a Colada enjoyers are wondering why their rumdars arenâ€™t going off, itâ€™s because thereâ€™s not much worthwhile about this crew. Tepid power in most areas equates to scant usage at best.

Debuting on the wrong side of the voyage power curve, Rumdarâ€™s anti-matter seating is even worse, although an eclectic trait set should see him squeak out the occasional bonus-matching voyage from time to time a la MED/CMD crew or other rare skill sets. View him as having potentially above average longevity there relative to his rank, but a low appearance frequency.

Where Rumdar does most of his damage is in making your opponents have to view his atrocious art in the gauntlet. His overall power is again poor with a proficiency total sitting next to some launch day cards, but he has fistfuls of 25% gauntlets and a DIP/SEC roll that can win against most non-exclusive options with a useful ENG tertiary. Again, not a power option and perhaps not an option at all for veteran players, but itâ€™s a saving grace for an otherwise pre-aged card.
