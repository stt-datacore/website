Leland would be a forgotten man if not for his two big anchor points - Disco (and Section 31) events for a bonus tally that blows by household names and triggerless arena damage which is just a step below the big shipboard options and does a fine job of shortening the skirmish grind. If you're well stocked in those areas, his only other point of interest is a middling gauntlet pair which occasionally pops up with 45% crit. He's a good starter crew, but has a ceiling of Disco requistion shuttles on established rosters.
