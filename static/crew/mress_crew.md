A crew to give Ari Bn Bem a run for his money as the best TAS representation in game. M'Ress offers your standard base/voyage considerations, with a bent toward the former. Unfortunately, TAS being regarded as it is and with a dearth of eventable traits, requisition shuttle stuffer might be her ceiling for many rosters without event bonuses to look forward to.

Aside from some usable, if vanilla arena accuracy, you'll primarily be deploying M'Ress on voyages. A somewhat average power level on debut is compensated for by a plus skill set, giving her a 2-3 year projected window of use on most rosters.
