I am sorry your Majesty, but WRG promised me another top tier Pike card and....who can turn that down?

At your service, for 25 pieces of the King’s gold, is the brave and loyal Amand Rauth.  Finding seats among 6 different traits and having a new-to-the-variant skill order of CMD/SCI/SEC, certainly you will find a place in your royal court for this devoted squire.  Voyages aren’t where his usefulness to your needs end, oh no – rather he will cheerfully staff your daily shuttles and, when the time comes, avail him in Events where he has prolific bonus opportunities.

Oh, per chance, did you scoff at his lowly 1 Collection? Thou dost overlook Rauth’s growth potential into 5 potential Collections that would be the highlight of any royal ball.  Beyond today, but a fortnight (or 24) from now, this regal companion will be a force to be reckoned with solving nodes....just don’t look for him in Gauntlet or in Ship Battles, as he may be gallantly misplaced in those dignified efforts.

Verily, lest I neglect to call your gaze upon his true crown jewel – his hair that makes any other bouffant skulk behind the nearest Red Guard.
All hail the king!
