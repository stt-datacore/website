Her base and voyage power leaves quite a bit to be desired, but this was a crew made for the collection era with qualities ranging from a gorgeous trait set to Faction queen Janeway's weekend reputation and plus skill set for shuttles. The main course is her huge immediate and potential collection value and as a post-cryo value bundle, she's a name that most players cannot afford to overlook.
