Voyages, Events, Collections, and power enough to be relevant. Outside of a two year Event gap smack dab in the middle of the game's history, Bashir has been a fairly reliable Event name and Risa's smattering of Traits have helped paper over any holes in that domain. His DIP base cresting over 1,200 (with full bonuses) will earn him a thaw on almost any roster as his variants haven't traditionally enjoyed strong bases. 

While Voyage consideration for Super Rares can be tricky as 'Behold vs Event' and fusion level matters greatly, Risa is still top notch in a vacuum. His skill set appeals to both common and uncommon combos and his power sits just behind the elite. Bashir's traditional Collection duo of Engineered and Physician is the allure for veteran players while also providing a safety blanket for new players looking for a Citation candidate who can put in plenty of daily work for them while still paying off long-term. Speaking of long-term, Bashir still has at least one more long-shot Trait to add to a possible future Collection.
