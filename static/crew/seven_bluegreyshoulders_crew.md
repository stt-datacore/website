Built on a cracked foundation of traits, the tower of Seven is leaning more than ever. Raw gauntlet power had her a dominant force there years ago, but multiple ENG/SCI exclusives with better numbers and traits have crowded her out to a large extent. Still a worthwhile one star proposition for that area of the game, be aware that most of her matchups involve her going up against solid gauntlet walls comprised of bigger, meaner crew.

Stars two through five are not buying you much equity either. The Borg collection is likely to be the only one she ever calls home and those poor traits against hamstring her event work, never mind her poor bases. Certainly some pillars of good value exist with this OG Seven, but her power in most areas are too low for you to consider her anything but a niche option.
