It doesn’t end well for the prisoner of a thousand data rods, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be of use to us before his unceremonious end. He’s a daily workhorse for early to mid-game rosters, with the #1 ENG base, a usable (if pedestrian) ENG/SCI Voyage total, and a vanilla but un-handicapped +9 Accuracy ship ability that initializes quickly enough to have a chance to matter in Arena. He's a total zero in Gauntlet, and his big base numbers won’t get many chances to play on the weekend, but when he does, he's worth the thaw.
