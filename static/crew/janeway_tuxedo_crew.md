Welcome to Le Coeur de Lion. She's Katrine. And arguably better than Katrine v.1. A variant-best CMD may again be an asset with Groundhog Janeway making her first event appearance after a 14 month winter. Katrine's voyage work isn't particularly special, even with a splash of SCI, but in combination with her theoretical event value, she's at least an average crew. With thin, but possible use elsewhere, she's not quite a Jack of all trades, but perhaps a 9 or 10 of all trades.
