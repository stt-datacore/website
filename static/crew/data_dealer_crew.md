"Disoriented from being stuck in Jumanji for 26 years, Alan Parish questions the whereabouts of good crew and the current year."

This slide begins with objectively awesome flavor text and descends rapidly afterwards. As the *sixth* ENG primary legendary Data to grace the game, this gloomy Lurch look-alike is likely to be similarly window dressing for most players. A few tentpoles of good crew construction are in place (bankable events, a collection), but his power level is an anachronism - only a year away from mingling with his 3-4 year old variant brothers.

If you're a fan of his humorous scene, there can certainly be some first year usage to be had and a few traits look ripe for event/anti-matter/collection possibilities. Just be aware that this action figure comes out of the box already a bit weathered.
