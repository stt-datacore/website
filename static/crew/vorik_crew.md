On paper Vorik seems to be fairly reasonable with a #12 base stat which goes up to 800+ when maxed out. However his base stat is the worst among 3* crew and his single skill stat makes him the second worst voyager after Jake Sisko. His ship skills is standard for most engineers and will score 20% hull repair but it decreases the attack score by 2. Keep him if you are hunting for Vulcans but if you have to airlock him it wonâ€™t be long before he pops up again.
