Why yes, he DOES look appropriately sinister, don't you agree? On the one-eyed face of it, this particular pastiche of a Parisian Pickerd (I don't think JL is Parisian, but shh, the alliteration is so nice) is uninteresting - another CMD/DIP/SECcer, who cares, right? But sporting Koloth-esque voyage power, a bevy of useful traits, and now the new #1 base Picard SEC, he outperforms a mediocre base rank and a slightly empty resume elsewhere with style. Whether you think the Six Pack SpinTM is worth it is up to you, but he's definitely one of the better cards we've gotten recently.
