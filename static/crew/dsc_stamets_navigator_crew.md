Likely to be overshadowed by his alter-ego Mirror Stamets, Nav is still rock-solid crew in his own right. The new #1 Disco ENG is a significant attribute with DB's willingness to launch wave after wave of event bonuses. His above average voyage total, while sitting 200 points out of the top 10, is still strong enough to trump many older crew and makes Navigator a good investment for players looking to pick up strong event/voyage combos.
