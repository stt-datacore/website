DB has loaded up the ENG ranks and sent Scotty tumbling. Former megas Ru’afo and Janeway have taken over his non-bonus shuttle work, which is all Scotty can claim these days. While he may have had a glimmer of event relevance late in 2019 thanks to the TOS mega, I'd sooner bet on Inglatu getting an event bonus before he does, sadly enough. Jury Rigger is a scrap of value, but his usability doesn’t warrant the investment in many cases, especially not with the collection encroaching on being completable with just super rare crew. His value is higher than this ranking if you missed on a mega ENG, but even then he won’t match that ubiquitous power in Faction events.
