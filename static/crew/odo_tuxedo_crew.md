For a long time, Jazz Odo has been merely a good Super Rare crew. His inclusion in a vanity collection gives him a sliver of value at the behold portal, but considering how little he contributes day to day, I would suggest finishing that collection's reward with honor rather than spend five beholds of value on this Odo. He's ranked for his to-date performance, but several eventable traits give him hope for catching extra event bonuses down the line.
