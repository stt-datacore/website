Kim fans, I know you're out there. Congratulations on competent in-game representation. Before this variant came along, the best use we usually got out of his five outfits was an easy breezy one star crew build to spam for the dilithium achievement. This time around Cap'n Kid brings more power to his game, even if it won't knock your socks off. Shuttle numbers that can hang with anyone outside the top ten and two of his bases are also variant-best for a modest, but consistent handful of events.

On voyages there are a couple familiar faces above him in the ranks (Braxton, La Borg), but his numbers are good enough to keep him inside the top ten CMD/ENG options. His utility isn't terribly broad and a poor trait set and Faction event rate aren't doing him any favors, but for a Kim crew, this is like being promoted to Admiral.
