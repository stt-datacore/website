Top DIP bases, very nice proficiency and a top 10 3* voyager. One of the best cards a new roster can have. His unexpected MED stat gives him some fantastic voyage flexibility. It's not often you get crew members in this rarity that can excel in both shuttles and voyages but Picard and his stunning jacket certainly make the cut. A hefty shield regeneration ship ability and decent traits makes him finally one of the best represented Picard cards in the game.
