Neither of Torres’ bases are impressive and she may not even make event shuttles before four stars, but she also has a handful of possible one-off event traits and the Torres event cushion. Those traits also do their best to make her a gauntlet capable two-skiller, however she sports two merely average rolls and will need both skills to line up, meaning she often performs better on paper than in game. Despite a trio of 45% gauntlets and one 65% set, Torres is a risky pick at best who’ll often find herself drowning in a sea of Tribbled Koloth and Korax.

Her collection value, at least, is worth noting and in concert with sporadic weekend work makes Torres a fine low end dart throw in beholds if you don’t mind long term investments.
