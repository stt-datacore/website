We must return to our Dejarens. We must reclaim what we were and follow the path the Serosians have laid out for us. It is their will that the voyagers return to their ships, base crew to their shuttles, instant damage crew to the arena. If we do this, if we follow our Dejarens, then Timelines will flourish again and become the green and peaceful land I remember. It will be as if the episode 'Revulsion' never happened. By returning to our Dejarens, we will have erased it forever.
