With blanket Disco bonuses presumably drying up, Saru's drip feed of one event yearly isn't quite enough to support two 1k (but ultimately average) bases, though a few traits (namely Exobiology) are doing their best to boost that count. There's not much utility otherwise. His plus skill set is sadly paired with voyage power that is sinking into unusable and is not a recommended investment any longer. He still hits a few areas well enough to sit in the add-the-star range for the foreseeable future.
