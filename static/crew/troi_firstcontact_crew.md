'Drunk Troi' is the worst variant for her cost, probably even down to the one star level. Flaccid stats everywhere except in the arena serve to pigeonhole her into Faction event work. Even the always desirable MED skill doesn't save her; for voyages it sits behind one of her super rare variants and for base it may require all five stars to make an event impact. Even if you're desperate for MED, triple check your other behold options before taking the Commander over useless or redundant options.
