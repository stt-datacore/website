“Why are we still here? Just to suffer?”

A question that can be interpreted in so many ways, but let’s focus our energy on the task at hand – Mirror Mariner.
Long have players of Timelines bemoaned the Gauntlet – for its RNG or lack of RNG, for the seemingly impossible odds to win good rewards, and the lack of ability to get guaranteed drops of new or old Crew.  Now we can add another layer to the “complaint-cake”, and it is a delicious, moist, and flavorful cake layer indeed: A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES!

Yes, that’s the name of the Collection for Gauntlet characters, but also the theme of the game lately.  “Hey players, we heard you like exclusive reward crew, so we’re adding way more!  Thanks for playing!”  Thanks, indeed. Two short months after Fist Fight Archer was introduced as a serviceable reward for Gauntlet, he was metaphorically benched when the coach wanted a fresh player with no fouls to come in for the 3rd quarter – enter Mirror Mariner.

The first Gauntlet exclusive crew that has no use in the Gauntlet, Mirror Mariner is a Voyage and Shuttle beast.  Usurping Technician Uhura from her three-month stent as the top DIP crew, Mariner is set for daily use in absolutely any roster in the game...you just have to get her first.  At the rate WRG is printing new cards with insane stats, it is doubtful that Mariner will hold to that top DIP spot for four and a half years like Professor Sato.  Still though, her high DIP  Base is nothing to go to the Agonizer Booth over.

The real murderous use of Gauntlet Exclusive Mirror Mariner (GEMM) is on your Voyages – where she shines in three bonus seats with best-in-class scores, all for the glory of the Emperor.  Players so new that the didn’t get Federation President Archer a few months ago will love her, however those who didn’t start playing today may have comparable cards with equal use.  Veteran players from ....*checks notes* eight months ago will have GEMMs lesser cousin, Insubordinate Mariner.  Even still, a strong voyager a day keeps the Emperor from murdering you.

And therein lays the issue at hand that does not want me to shout TERRA FIRMA – obtaining one of the best Voyaging characters in the game – I have to play Gauntlet and roll my proverbial dice.  Let’s not forget to mention across the street, in the Admiral Black note, you’ll be reminded that he’s the new absolute “Belle of the Ball” for Gauntlet....that you can only earn in Voyages...with insanely low odds.....this is beginning to sound familiar.....

This has turned from a review of a ‘powerful and otherwise great card, really an upscaled version of a previously released Mega-card’ – to an editorial on the ability to actually get this card and use it.  Will we be repeating this sentiment in two months when GEMM, like Fist Fight Archer, is benched by the coach for another new player to come in the fourth quarter?  Will we all continue to suffer playing RNG controlled methods at obtaining powerful and useful crew, watching as many become distanced by constant abuse with no reward?
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
