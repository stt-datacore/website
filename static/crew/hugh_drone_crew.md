Just as I was beginning to write this summary the news that Hugh will be in the new series of Picard instantly bumped him up a Tier. His use in a potential future event is almost a certainty but I might well be re-writing this in the future, we’ll see.
Stats wise though he has the lowest 3* SEC primary base stat that, whilst being higher than most lower rarity cards, is still a little disappointing compared to better Rare crew. It’s nothing amazing but it might just bump a Voyage up 20 minutes or so.
