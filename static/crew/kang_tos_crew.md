A difficult crew to rank in a vacuum, Kang's value (outside of whatever collection considerations there are) rests on his arena ability. A massive attack boost when triggered from cloak makes him a singular name in the Captain's division of arena and lower Boss Battle difficulties. The value of rewards in those areas is questionable, but his dominance there makes him a must-have if that's a part of your game.
