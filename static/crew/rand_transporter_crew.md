A card that resembles her prowess at transporter techniques, Transporter Chief/murderer Rand is less a useful card than she is decoration for your Motion Picture inspired bridge crew. Don't let her determined expression lead you into thinking that her engineering prospects are half way good because in what possible events are you looking to use her in anyways?

We'll bring back an old classic for this one and tweak it for the square root lovers out there - "4 traits, 2 skills, 1.4142 airlock."
