Travis is used to getting guff from players, but his 900+ ENG base combos well with a 100% hit rate for Mayweather Factions and a trio of big bonus features. You're not likely to use him very often, but in between reprieves from cryo, he'll be contributing to two collections including the huge, 100 threshold Costume Party.
