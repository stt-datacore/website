One of the few crewmembers who cannot participate in any of the cadet challenges, has the worst primary CMD stat of any crew and a pretty poor SEC stat too. Has a few useful traits but not the stats to back it up. His ship ability, whilst powerful, relies on you having a ship with the Position ability, but not worth using in Arena as most uncommons and rares will give you much more usefulness at their base level. Bye Bye!
