Not the worst skill set for voyages (I thought all Bartenders got MED?), Tuvok's power there is in its twilight, but still has a bit of juice left. Working in his favor is a chunk of SEC/SCI that most Tuvok variants supply, but what he provides on voyages would seem to be the side dish to his bases.

Tuvok's event chances have never been prodigious, but in combination with traits have actually grown over the years and he's now claimed a featured event in four consecutive years. His DIP primary sits at or near the top of his variants and viable traits while a 1k SECondary will lend some Faction flexibility as well. He's not special, or even great, but he's a fine event puzzle piece who can find voyage work on the right rosters, and you could do worse than starring him up if you're looking for Vulcans to finish the collection with that aren't Soval or Gangster Spock.
