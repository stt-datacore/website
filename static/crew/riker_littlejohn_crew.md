Let's face it - you've gotta be a man to wear tights. Especially with this kind of confidence. But as your mother may have taught you, confidence isn't everything. This Littlest of Johns is first and foremost Event crew.

That's no bad thing, especially as an elite SEC option for his character - his down year would be a career year for Scotty. But with thin Trait options for further bonuses or Collections, his ceiling is limited, even if he's already met most of his potential. Consider him also as an option in Fleet Boss Battles in the Hull Repair Meta, since he has a 25% Hull Repair Ability with an Attack Boost, with a just-off-the-best-in-class Cycle Time of 24s.
