From arguably the best episode in the history of Star Trek comes inarguably Timelines' best version of Garak. He is tailor-made (groan) for the weekend, with variant-best (and Cardassian-best) SEC and ENG bases paired with an event count that seems to be picking up speed and could hit on any of several potential eventable traits. He's no slouch for daily use either, with SEC/ENG voyage metrics placing him right in the thick of things and a 400% damage ship ability similar to previous campaign crew Leland, which pairs excellently with a Killy/RP Commandant to make a strong one-two punch for Arena and Skirmishes. I don't know about you, but I'd call THAT a bargain.
