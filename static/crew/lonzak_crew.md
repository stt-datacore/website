We're living in a world where we have to admit that Lonzak is a good crew. Just aim the death ray at me right now. Besides the obvious base and voyage numbers that spell out good daily capability, he's got a half dozen relevant traits for boosting voyage anti-matter and event chances. A year from now, this note may detail Lonzak's triumphs in the Villian and Romantic megas. If you're a collection or nostalgia chaser looking to tick the vanity collection boxes, Lonzak is one of the better places to start.
