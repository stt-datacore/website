First of all, 'Ba'ul movement' is a hilarious account name and I can't be convinced otherwise. Secondly, despite looking like something that Armus coughed up, there's some value here.

On ships, Ba'ul's 400% boomstick may be helpful to many players despite a cloak trigger, thanks to the portal introduction of the Valdore and the Dabo-able Bounty ships. Its short and eclectic trait set doesn't do it any favors for events or voyage anti-matter, though they may bear fruit as collection options down the line.

Voyages are really the name of the game. Despite a single anti-matter trait and somewhat average power, Ba'ul has a fantastic skill set to make runs in a few different tricky skill combos and is an alright behold choice for that reason if you think you can fuse them in time for them to find work there. They're in big trouble once their power excuses them from voyages, but, hell, anything beats another CMD/DIP/SUCK.
