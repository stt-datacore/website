A relative dud in Über campaign terms, Mariner is helped out primarily by what you don’t see. Very much lacking in utility, she at least claims a couple hidden traits to get her on the collection board with EV Suit and Animated, neither of which seem likely to factor into future events. Thin on relevant front-facing traits, she may only ever work out on weekends for variant-flavored adventures.

With woeful voyage power for a new release, Mariner could see a few rides there early on thanks to the fusion level advantage that comes from campaigns, but before too long she’ll be relegated to daily shuttle runs on the back of her competent CMD base.
