Combine a few variant and trait events with double 1k bases and Khan is essentially a usable shuttle crew _augmented _(eh? eh?) with a scoop of ENG. His primary changes from base to voyage, but that doesn't affect his voyage potential as much as his critical tertiary ENG. 250% instant damage in arena is Super Rare levels of power, but with +9 accuracy and great passive values, he's still fairly effective there for younger rosters. Wrathful toes the line between workhorse and bit player, but the odds are good that an average roster will find work for him.
