Debate the vedek. Always, always choose to debate the vedek. Why? Because it’s the only way you’re landing one of the best voyage exclusives. In the arena, he flexes his muscles as one of the premier defensive options. A fat stack of evasion and shield repair is available early enough to thwart almost any incoming damage and measures up well against even legendary options.

Surface level base and voyage metrics look alright for Chuck, but considering rosters generally collect copies at a glacial pace from voyages, by the time you have him fused up you may only need him as an infrequent Faction event thaw or for his bankable spot in the Costumed collection.
