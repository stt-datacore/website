One of the stronger entrants in the popular CMD league. He has a #8 CMD stat with a proficiency bonus that boosts him up to #4 CMD max. That combined with a +5 Attack ship bonus and 20% attack speed gives him strong use in Arena and Skirmish. He is let down by his lack of voyage potential, no cadet participation and a lack of extra collections. But if you are looking for some strong CMD then heâ€™s a fairly good choice.
