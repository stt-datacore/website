Miss Lily does have "variants" and an "event count", but with neither being impressive, nor her aged voyage power, the gauntlet is perhaps her best chance for 'real' usage. We won't oversell her dice rolling ability to you, but DIP/ENG really only has The Red Angel as competition and Lily's seven (!!!) 45% gauntlets give her more chances to perform than most edge case gauntleteers. 

Beyond that she's pure, distilled collection goodness. A few humongous stat-boosters and a vanity makes her an easy choice over perhaps hundreds of older, bit part legendaries and gives her some security in that area even if WRG decides to stop updating collection thresholds. With a handful of untapped traits (mostly large pools[read:many stat boosts]), Lily has the *potential* to be one of the most valuable collection crew in the game moving forward.
