Elnor is pretty much the textbook definition of an empty calories base - and yet, weirdly enough, even there, he's somewhat disappointing for a musketeer. Out of the entire SEC top ten, he and Ripper make for the only two skillers - and even in that competition, he's edged out by Discovery's barn-storming tardigrade by a two whole points. Somewhat strange that Ripper is being preserved from power creep so fastidiously, but here we are, left with a choice.

As with any Picard crew, you'll undoubtedly get use out of Elnor  - more than most event dross, I'd wager, given his Romulan, Spiritual, Duelist and Survivalist traits. But there are very few fringe benefits to be found here, and I foresee only so many character variants for Space Legolas that won't be the same skill set, just with face-lifted numbers. Personally, I would definitely regret the choice.
