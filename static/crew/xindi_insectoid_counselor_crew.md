See Sisko, Prophet Sarah. Though we may squeeze the odd event out of his four traits, the bug doesn't really need them to be an elite daily use crew. Non-event bases are typically non-starters, but in this case you have a voyager you'll never freeze who can handle shuttle duty admirably for two different skills. Double collections, including the newly expanded Diplomat, are actually attainable despite him being a weekend non-starter - this is definitely a crew worthy of citations. He's in the mix among the best non-event crew in the game.
