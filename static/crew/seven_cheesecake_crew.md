Perverting science and technology never felt so right. Fusion, hybrid, abomination - whatever you want to call these experiments by WRG, this one, at least, hasn't disappointed. There are several talking points here, but let's start with Seven's pristine skill order which (s)he only shares with the less powerful Torpedo McCoy among golds. In combination with a worthwhile total score and voyage MED, (s)he's among the most impactful voyagers in the game whose value above replacement blows past CMD/SEC also-rans with similar overall numbers.

Equally as mouth-watering is event eligibility to rival the fabled Zhian'tara Odo. Triggering bonuses for Doc, Seven, and a multitude of traits, (s)he has one of the safest event cushions in the game. Coupled with easily the best MED of the bunch and usable SCI, (s)he's guaranteed to add big, fat success numbers to Faction shuttles that will fail at 99% anyways.

We'll take the downsides (gauntlet, arena) in stride, as her power/usefulness combo in other areas is simply outstanding. If you can find a Mobile Doc between the couch cushions, upgrade him to this version and flip on the telly to watch Patrick Stewart, Jeri Ryan, and company Fridays on UPN!
