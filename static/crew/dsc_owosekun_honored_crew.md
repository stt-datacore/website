One of the supplementary bridge crew characters from Discovery, Owo’s Event pedigree was based almost entirely upon her inclusion in those oft-heralded Mega Events, but this particular variant’s Event has been rerun once already, so look to possibly pick up extra stars from a possible rererun (anything is possible with WRG!). Outside of this, Owo will top out at four Collections, which is slightly above average for a Legendary, and may acquire some additional weekend work from those ancillary Traits.
