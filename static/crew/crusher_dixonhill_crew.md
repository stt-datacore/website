A big, fat gauntlet MED roll is her most noteworthy attribute. A couple of ranked gauntlet pairs among all crew establishes her baseline power and can be absolutely deadly when she hits 65% crit. Her inclusion in the Costume Party solidifies her as a name to target for rosters at every stage of the game and gives her a trio of collection spots of varying gameplay importance. Crusher is never likely to blossom into an event player, especially with repugnant bases, but if gauntlet luck be a lady, her name is Doc Crusher.
