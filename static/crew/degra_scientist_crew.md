Degra is as unique and stellar as non-event 2-skill crew get. He's the best arena damage at 0-5 seconds and can allow you to pull off some really neat tricks given the right supplemental tools. Triple collections is something that is always hard to ignore and his vanity collection may hint at some ENT/Xindi event possibilities in the future which would take Degra from luxury pick to key cog, at least for a short time. I've previously noted limited voyage work for him, but as ENG/SCI pairings become more common, his chances there have diminished.
