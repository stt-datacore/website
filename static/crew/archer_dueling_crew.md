Ushaan's bases are...problematic, but at least in the back half of 2018 DB remembered he exists and gave him a few chances to put them to work on the weekends since. Equally poor are voyage numbers that have a view of several 2-skillers breathing down his neck. His two most useful attributes are relatively marginal - the first being a SEC proficiency just outside the top ten, though capping out at 25% crit and with tons of competition, it doesn't go as far as that implies. Aside from a tough node unlock, his strengths (or lack thereof) make him most valuable as a one star proposition, rather than an actual investment.
