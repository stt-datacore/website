A slightly goofy, endearing, dancing Jean-Luc was certainly feeling his oats after a trip to the Ba'ku planet and it shows in this card. One of the rare times a crew moves upward in the Big Book, Mambo's dual 1k bases are in line for an uptick in weekend usefulness with ST:Picard debuting in 2020. Between regular event work and strong gauntlet credentials including big DIP and DIP/CMD rolls, Mambo will perform in several corners of your gameplay.

His voyage score has held up well, but sadly, Mambo's no longer number one, two, three-four-five in the DIP/SCI ranks, pushed down by base heavy AoS Picard, further populating a skillset which is curiously quite common at the top of the charts. That's not to say he's superfluous, in fact if anything his utility over cards like Xindi Insectoid or Sarah Sisko make him the more useful piece most of the time, but he does grow harder to justify citing as his particular niche fills out. If he's hanging around your roster (or inbox) at 1/5, consider feeding him some honor if he offers what you need.
