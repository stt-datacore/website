Her Discovery-esque ratio of events per season of television is impressive and she sports dual 1k bases to match. Two event features alongside the impressive RAF Miles and Bashir give her a chance to win you some powerful crew, even if the re-run reward structure dictates that they may be found more easily in the thresholds. She's premium ENG/SEC voyage material despite her age and also offers a tricky node unlock available from 1/5.
