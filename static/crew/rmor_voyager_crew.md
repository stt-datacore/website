Like Technician Rom this is another card you don’t want to miss on Tuesday’s cadet missions. Whilst this three skilled card might have some use voyaging he does sport the worst SEC stats in the game, but this doesn’t take away from his usefulness. His max SCI is the highest for a 2* and will be one of your key voyagers in the early game to secure that two hour dilemma, just don’t expect to hold on to him for long.
