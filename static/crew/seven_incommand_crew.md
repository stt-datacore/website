Mom! I want a Malibu Seven of Nine!
No dear, you already have a Seven of Nine doll.
But MOM! This Malibu Seven of Nine has a chair!

Big news for people who really, *really* like chairs – boy do I have a new card for you!  The returning black cloud of Tuesday Packs brings us the 40th Borg of the 40 tier collection, Seven in Command.  

Sitting comfortably in command of the Stargazer, Seven shows us where she will ultimately preside over her daily duties for years to come.  Unfortunately, that’s where the future of this card stops.  Outside of being the only current way to complete the stat-boosting Borg Collection, Seven in Command will sit on the bench of most rosters.

With an unboosted Voyage score firmly behind at least 250 other options, Seven in Command (SiC) has only 8 bonus seats going for her.  Outside of those boosted Antimatter chances, you won’t find her piloting your crew to the great 13 hour thresholds or beyond.

Four Stat-Boosting Collections are the only allure to not-yet Captain Seven, as her daily shuttle use or arena use won’t come into play for anyone.  Events will be the last bit of usefulness – with potential upcoming Picard Season Three events – but until then, she needs to stay in her seat and far away from your crew quarters.
