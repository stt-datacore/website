Released a few months after Caldos Crusher, this Century version is a step down in almost every respect. It’s true that the usability of crew is not contained entirely within their relation to their variant siblings, but it sure does reek of lazy copy/paste from a studio that’s known for that.

The lone point of interest here is a middling voyage power saddled with a skill set which is more common than you might think. Unless you’re already on star three or four when mulling her as a behold choice, there’s a good chance she’ll be superfluous by the time you finish her.

The Crusher character at least had her best event year by a country - sorry, Century mile in 2021. If WRG decides to break with their first five years of tradition and give her more weekend love in the future, she could settle in as a viable if low end event/collection combo crew.
