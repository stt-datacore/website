It’s a glorious day when Uncle Phil from “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” joins Star Trek Timelines, in the form of General K’Vagh from the Klingon Augments Arc of Enterprise.

The Spring of 2023 featured some subpar Legendary crew following the introduction in short succession of Exclusive crew Chances Taken Kirk and Mirror Tuvok, but looks like we’re climbing the Power Creep Escalator™ again with this fancy new Klingon! Top 35 Voyage ranking on debut with four current Collections will whet your appetite for a fine Citation target, and he avoids the trap of most Klingons by having a SCI secondary and avoiding the CMD/DIP/SEC doldrums of many of his older peers.

WRG’s formula for good Legendary crew is as follows now - strong primary base (CMD), a small handful of debut Collections (four), plus a trait or two more for a rainy day (Interrogator, Tactician). What’s also lovely about K’Vagh is that he has five Voyage Antimatter seats and is among the top choices for them. Plus he has a 400% Instant Damage ability on ships with a quickish 8s activation and a 18s cycle (though sadly a Boarding trigger). If you don’t have MACO Mayweather and are ISM poor, or don’t want to wait to FF him, he might be a poor man’s replacement.
