The age old and fittingly Honorable question; is Kahless worth his price tag? For the first time since the Big Book began, the answer has gone from 'conditional yes' to 'conditional maybe'.

His primary point of interest, the gauntlet, now provides his greatest competition for free. Gauntlet exclusive Balok matches Kahless' average CMD roll exactly while sporting better overall power and flat out dumb amounts of big crit gauntlets. While their differing skill order buffets Kahless against Balok's dominance slightly, it inarguably dings him. Still, a half dozen 45%+ gauntlets for Kahless himself gives him plenty of leeway and he's still a clear cut above all other CMD primary gauntleteers. 

The next question is 'should I cite?'. The answer will depend on who you ask, but with a few collections to his name and voyage power that's 'good for everyone except CMD/DIP/SEC', he can at least make an argument. In either case, he remains a wonderfully valuable choice; another option for your honor.
