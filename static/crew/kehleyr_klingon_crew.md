The folks over at the 'Plakson's Pals' fan club (not to be confused with Combs' Chums) are flipping cartwheels over the first of what we hope are four variants from the smolderingly steamy season two Klingon romance episode. But is the crew actually good for non-fanatics? Well...

The overall voyage power is there as of her debut, though in the worst possible skill set. If K'Ehleyr is an affection choice, the fuse light is green. For everyone else, it's a matter of when and how many stars you have on her as to whether or not you want to fuse her up for voyages, or wait for multi-star situations like Mega events and Campaigns to provide you with all you'll need of the ubiquitous CMD/DIP/SEC set.

Relatively depressed bases result in proficiencies that support middling gauntlet ability (again, in competitive pairs) which might pop for her lone 45% gauntlet, but not much else. The #8 Klingon (and Undercover Operative) base is about as much hope as we can hold out for mega action, but long time players may remember previous features, making Klingon K'Ehleyr's introductory weekend her fifth, and hopefully not last, event bonus.
