“I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.”

Stella aside, Mudd's golden days of holding down Discovery ENG or pushing your voyages ever longer are over. He still has a handful of traits to get him some shuttle work beyond what his otherwise poor bases would demand. Outside of that, his low-ish power will get him lost in the shuffle of new crew who have base and voyage scores hundreds of points higher. Most likely a freeze and forget name for the EV Suit collection.
