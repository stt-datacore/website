Phlox is a mirror MED monster. Great at one star for gauntlet and fully fused for voyages and shuttles. His voyage MED lead over the pack has been shaved away at, but still years later no one can come close. Combined with a rare MED/SEC stack, he earns voyage seating past 8-9 hours. Three ranked gauntlet pairs among all crew including the #1 MED/SEC roll make him perhaps the best super rare crew available in that area.

A whopping SIX different traits have previously snagged event bonuses and he's been featured event crew twice. He boasts triple collection spots and he's even one of the very few instant damage arena crew to fit the MED slot. Undeniably great in every facet of the game and my choice for best Super Rare.
