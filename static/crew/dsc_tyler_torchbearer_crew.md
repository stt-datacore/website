You're going to want to snag the caped crusader at some point for his collection spots, but there's a little more meat on the bone elsewhere. Tyler's SEC base is thaw-worthy a few times per year, even if the curtain is down on Discovery megas, and of more interest to newer accounts is a strong +9 attack boost on ships which lasts long enough to allow you to line up whatever motley assortment of damage and crit crew you can cobble together at that point in your Timelines journey.
