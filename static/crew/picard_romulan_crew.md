Soupicard did hold up better than most CMD/DIP/SUCK have any right to, but he’s more of an Allen wrench at this stage. Four second arena evasion is certainly fast enough to ward off most attacking ships and a tidy collection profile is at least a step up from wearing nothing at all…nothing at all…nothing at all.

If you complete the collection Trek to five stars, you’ll be able to leverage Picard’s otherwise mediocre bases when they catch a bonus on the weekends. His event tally has been fairly reliable on balance and he owns enough traits to help maintain that pace. As a cherry on top, a large number of elevated crit gauntlets meet proficiencies best left to new players, but his DIP/SEC roll at 45% is certainly nothing the opposition will want to tangle with.
