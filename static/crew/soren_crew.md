Not just missing some would-be useful traits like Maverick or Hero, but also any semblance of usability too, Soren is merely a short bundle of traits waiting for WRG to favor them in the form of collections or megas. As their arena ability suggests, they offer nothing that canâ€™t be found attached to more capable crew, leaving them as a trait dart throw in dead-end beholds.
