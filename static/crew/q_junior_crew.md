Qunior's worthwhile CMD base should merit the occasional thaw and his big bonus features thus far have run the gamut on event types. But for those (long) stretches where he's stuck in cryo, there's at least some nice collection value with room for more, especially with how WRG likes to highlight John de Lancie and the whole Q clan.
