A cheeky fecker in the worst way, at least this time Rumps is tucked away in a Tuesday pack where we can safely ignore him. Probably.

If you’ve taken the plunge anyways, you can welcome aboard a strong voyager with enough anti-matter traits and a skill set that’s fairly underrepresented at the super rare level. Once your roster transitions to Fields of Gold, he’s still worth the weekend thaw when his traits are bonus. That’s happened inconsistently to date, but with those same traits providing solid collection value, you’ll probably come across his “no chance of passing this drug test” card art periodically after immortalizing him.
