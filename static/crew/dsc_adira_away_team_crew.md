Adira gets their second non-gold variant with this Away Team Super Rare variant from the Season 4 Discovery premiere “Kobayashi Maru”.  While the Discovery-era away team uniforms are amazing to look at (see Away Teams Burnham and Saru and Tactical Stamets for examples), unfortunately the artist in this case did the actor no favors with the facial likeness.  Yikes.

That being said, Away Team Adira is a well-rounded purple for new players and elderly alike.  For newer players, they debut with 3 stars just from the easily achievable thresholds of a Skirmish event and are easily cited, and with a plus skill set (ENG/DIP/SEC).

Also tucked away into their tactical vest are 3 collections at release (including the new Discovery show collection yay!), plus a nearly-certain Trill collection inclusion.  Don’t forget, we’ve already gotten 2 of the 3 options in the Player’s Choice Vote (Prodigy and Gambler) so Trill is almost guaranteed.  That does seem to tap them out on collection value, unless 4 years down the line WRG is desperately scraping the bottom of the trait barrel and we get the Desperate collection!

If you’re still using purples on voyages, their power (top 50 on release), skill set and traits will let them ride occasionally for a little while until you can acquire more fused-up golds.  Cursory check on gauntlet - nope, nothing.  Anemic proficiencies.

Perhaps the hidden gem is Adira’s ship ability for the new hotness of Fleet Boss Battles.  In the current meta of Hull Repair, they have a 20% repair with no limits, and a 24s cycle.  If you don’t yet have the best gold HR crew like Dereth, Laborer Kirk, etc. they may provide a reasonable bridge to FBB setups until you can acquire the others via begold or Crew Retrieval.
