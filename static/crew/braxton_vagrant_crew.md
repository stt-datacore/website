Considering the charges of vagrancy, this particular Braxton does in fact have a home - a special place and a warm bed, right here in tier 10. With event chances as pitiable as these (Temporal Agent has about 4 crew, so don't expect a mega out of that), any two skiller would struggle to find relevance, but the SCI/CMD stack is a horse that isn't so much beaten as it is turned into a fine pulp. It may not be the future's end, but it certainly is an ignominious one for poor ol' Braxton.
