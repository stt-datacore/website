An older crew, the Vicar is handicapped from the start. The former Jack of all trades is more like a four or five of all trades these days, thanks to power creep. Uncommon voyage skill set, arena crit ability, reasonable 2017 proficiencies...the breadcrumbs are there for a crew that used to perform much better.

Still, Bareil is nearly an auto-pick at the behold screen for veteran rosters thanks to his multi-collection status and a little room for expansion in that area. Very new and very established rosters will find ways to use Bareil, but those of you cruising in the mid-game looking for more immediate help may be merely whelmed by his offerings.
