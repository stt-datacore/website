Worthwhile daily numbers on debut are always welcome for crew who don't have variants and their characters' Events to fall back on. Invader has a window of Voyage use for newer players thanks to a SCI/SEC stack that can be tricky to flesh out at the Legendary level and should put in work for the first year or so after release. 

A substantial SCI Base can also pitch in on age-appropriate rosters and would pop big with an Event bonus, but Invader is living Mega Event to Mega Event and will need his Traits to align to make a difference on weekends. The highlight for children of all ages is his Collection value headlined by two Stat-boosting inclusions and one Vanity. Multi-Collection pieces will seemingly never go out of style and are your week-to-week Event mementos gathered to eventually help boost crew power at the Legendary level.
