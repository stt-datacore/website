If any character deserves the caregiver trait, it’s absolutely Raffi. The Canadian singer/songwriter gave joy to millions of kids for many decades. Wait…what? They gave it to Raffi Musiker? Raffi “I don't think you understand just how much it sucked to be your kid” Musiker? Raffi “Tell me what was worth ignoring me and Dad until we hardly recognized you” Musiker?

Well, as the saying goes, “If you can’t make them good, at least make them wrong.” Without that dubious collection spot, Raffi is a whole lotta nothing ranging from laughable stats and utility to a painfully thin trait list set to be “revived” by a late 2022 Casual/Luau-themed mega and subsequent collection.

New players who are able to fuse her for free may find use for some fast-activating arena accuracy if they can handle the evasion handicap, but that shouldn’t keep Raffi out of cryo for long.
