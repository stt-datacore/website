Is he holding a drill or a disruptor? It’s hard to tell, but Roga Danar sure is holding on to some lasting value due to all the Traits he has. The best Angosian in the game has a trio of current Collections and two more viable Traits to add to that count in the future, and those associated Traits can set him free from Cryostasis a few times a year to add his serviceable SEC Base to your Shuttles.
