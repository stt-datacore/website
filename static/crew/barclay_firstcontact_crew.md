Little more than collection fodder, Reg's best and perhaps only shot at 'real' use will come in his lone 65% gauntlet. Paired with an underrepresented ENG roll, he has a shot to pick up a win here or there, even though walls of The Red Angel likely await him. Beyond that, he has only a single trait that's not comically overstuffed, which limits his opportunity at value expansion. 

Barclay's beholds will often be a simple equation; if his collection count is higher than that Aleek-Om or Karyn Archer across from him, take the collections.
