{"id":371,"symbol":"event_hvge_stowaway","name":"Stowaway","description":"A galactic manhunt for a parasitic entity who has already blazed a trail of destruction only becomes more difficult when other parasites take on new hosts to hide their ally. Can you separate friend from foe when anyone can be harboring a killer?","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In this Hybrid Event, you will complete Voyages in one phase, and Supply Missions in another phase.\n-- In the Voyage Phase, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each contest: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance for the contest.\n-- Using Henoch Spock, any version of O'Brien, Buckley, Kes, or Compromised crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points during the Voyage Phase, as well as bonus to Supply Missions during the Galaxy Phase.\n-- Using the Borg Cube, the Arctic One, or the Klingon K'Vort Bird-of-Prey will provide a bonus to antimatter during the Voyage Phase.\n-- Using ships with the Borg trait will provide a bonus to antimatter during the Voyage Phase.\n-- In the Voyage Phase you earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- In the Galaxy Phase every Supply Mission you complete earns you Event Victory Points. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- Community Rewards are also available during Phase 2 only. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock these rewards before the phase change!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Henoch Spock, O'Brien, Buckley, Kes, or Compromised","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_hvge_stowaway.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":26402,"symbol":"seven_son_of_kvok_crew","name":"Seven","full_name":"Seven, Son of K'Vok","flavor":"Seven manifests the personalities of assimilated individuals.
