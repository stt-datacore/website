Hugh might make a few Voyages or unlock a few Nodes or carry you through a few Cadet Missions in the early game, but you’ll freeze and forget him soon enough. His narrow Trait list at least can go three for three on stat-boosting Collections once Maverick hits in the future.Stats wise though he has the lowest 3* SEC primary base stat that, whilst being higher than most lower rarity cards, is still a little disappointing compared to better Rare crew. It’s nothing amazing but it might just bump a Voyage up 20 minutes or so.
