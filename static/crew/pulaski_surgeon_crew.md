Turn your head and cough' jokes and All Red Everything bridge crew photos are the upper limit for this former 6-packer. Once coveted, kinda, for her huge MED base, she now sits ranked in the double digits. With that skill seating so scarce in faction events and Pulaski rarely catching a bonus...I'm afraid I've got some bad news, Doctor.

Kathy's lone 45% gauntlet and reasonable MED/SCI proficiency pair might make the cut for fledgling rosters and she does have *a* viable trait, leading to most behold selectors muttering, "At least she's a Physician". We've sounded caution on this crew for a long time due to her self-apparent trajectory and she hasn't deviated from it. Only behold this card if she sits across from Portal 63 and Cadet Sylvia Tilly.
