Not to be confused with older sister First Officer Burnham, this variant is a great event piece and...not terribly much else. Her voyage numbers are falling south of the equator for 3-skill crew and CMD/SEC has never hurt for options. EV's list of traits which swap between bloated and esoteric, likely won't provide much event help down the line, either. 

Luckily for her owners, you won't need it. Discovery has been leagues ahead of anything or anyone else in event opportunity for years and Burnham herself will never stop collecting variant opportunities. In combination with a fat CMD base to guarantee her a shuttle spot in any configuration, she's a fine behold option whose value swells a bit for players who lack top voyage options sharing her skill set.
