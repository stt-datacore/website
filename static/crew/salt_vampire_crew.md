A statistically above average crew, but without long-term benefits to look forward to, his expensive build may not be worth it for all players. A laundry list of required items from five different factions and 3* components out the wazoo. Situationally useful instant damage in arena. Check to make sure he will be an upgrade for you before selecting or leveling him.
