"Mr. Hawk...what are you doing in such a filthy uniform?" There's some fanfic we're happy didn't materialize. Uh, it doesn't exist...right?

Double 1k bases aren't quite so rare anymore, but Hawk ups the ante with dual 1100s to pair with a Borg trait that may splash again thanks to ST:Picard. Voyage work is likely to be Hawk's calling card, where a pinch of SCI solidifies strong stat ranks to create a facsimile of Mirror Jean-Luc Picard which outdoes the original. If you still need a legendary to finish either of his collections and Hawk is one of your options, "Make it so".
