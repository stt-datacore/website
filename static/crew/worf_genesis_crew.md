There's not much to unpack for Proto Worf. He's just what he looks like; a strong and dependable event crew. The best SEC and #2 CMD bases among Worfs (Worves?) as well as sharing the #2 Klingon SEC with Janeway. With traits he's well into double-digit events and will basically live on your shuttles for a long time.
