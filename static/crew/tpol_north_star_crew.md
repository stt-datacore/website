Let me give you a little bit of insight into how we write up crew in the Big Book of Behold Advice. Generally speaking, we get the raw stats, we get an event count, we get an idea of how rare the skill set is, how Gauntlet viable they are, go through the collections, see if they have any Arena utility, and then go from there. With this T'Pol, I've got to be honest with you, I didn't think that hard about it. My thought process was thus:

"She's worse than Twilight T'Pol, but better than Alternate Future T'Pol, so she goes here." It's rare that a crew slots so neatly into a tier based on its counterparts, but North Star T'Pol warrants it based on just how commonplace her offerings are nowadays. Same skill stack, different order (please read in the key of same shit, different day) to Pupcard, acting as an inferior, less free Tenavik, and basically being a straight upgrade to Alternate Future T'Pol with a vanity attached, make it hard to be excited about her. She's just good. And yes, that is meant to be damning with faint praise. The expansion to the Vulcan collection makes her slightly more appetising than when she first debuted, but how citeable she is for that purpose will depend heavily on your roster.
