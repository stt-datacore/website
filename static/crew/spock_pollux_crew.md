As they might say in merry old England, six packs are a load of old Pollux - but every now and then, in between the banger golds and the no collection no hopers like Outpost Vina, they slip in something for the elderly players among us: a purple you can grab one copy of, and simply cite at your leisure, knowing the investment will pay off no matter when you cash it in. Lush, Tolkein-esque art; two collections out of the gate with a strong possibility of another two; absolutely hench voyage power; and - yes, we're on our third semi-colon now! - Spock's traditionally excellent event profile supplemented by a somewhat rare strong DIP base for the original Vulcanian.

The only thing missing from Pollux's resume is being a Badda Bing-style gatekeeper of a suitably ridiculously powerful Elysian Kingdom collection only gold (perhaps King Ridley himself?), but debuting within weeks of the matching Princess Thalia is an encouraging sign if nothing else. If you snagged a copy, cite with confidence, and enjoy his tongue-in-cheek flavour text while you're at it.
