The Big Book will take the L for underselling Sisko's gauntlet ability for some time (goddamn interns). His top ten SEC roll does step into a very competitive pair when coupled with CMD, but an ENG kicker, an abundance of elevated crit gauntlets, and strong overall proficiency makes him a contender there and worthwhile one-star behold option.

Beyond that, there should be ample event opportunities for this main cast captain, including a handful of theoretically eventable traits. Those same traits promise to make him a collection horse as the game's lifespan approaches infinity, though it may take a while for the wheel of fortune to spin through all of them.
