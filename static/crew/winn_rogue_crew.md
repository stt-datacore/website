Winn has surprisingly picked up a few events, two of them features for this variant, and an optimist might have an eye toward Bajoran or Villain megas down the line. If you're thinking of using her more than once a year, go read Lissan's strikingly similar profile for daily use. She can handle a little gauntlet work in a super competitive pair, but to hold her ground against walls of Balok, elevated crit is a must.

Owning four viable traits dripping with story and flavor, it's definitely a possibility that she becomes a multi-collection piece and climbs in desirability for endgame rosters even before the ink dries on this note.
