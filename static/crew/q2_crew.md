In Qorbin's first note update since his release, we're here to tell you that we all had our daily use fun with him, but now it's time to pay the piper. His interesting voyage skill set no longer has interesting voyage power and in the theoretical world where every trait has a collection, Q3 is still limited to only, well... 

Gauntlet is sort of a pie in the sky perk here as many players have had years to find their Locutuses and with Qorbin not owning any big crit gauntlets, he'll have a tough go against several walls of crew with bigger, fatter scores. His goofy 90s jumpsuit and cheery demeanor will only go so far in seducing you to acquire him - the statistical goods backing that up aren't nearly as relevant as they once were.
