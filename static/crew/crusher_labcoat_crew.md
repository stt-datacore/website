Crusher here might not have the best stats out of all the MED crew in the game but I can guarantee that she will be the most useful. One of the first crew you will be bound to get and out of all the doctors is one of the easiest to equip. Her use on missions right at the start of the game makes her essential for use. Her only downsides is that she will be easily overshadowed once you start levelling up Nurse Kes or any of the other doctors.
