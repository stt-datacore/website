T'Pol has come back to earth following a stellar debut in early 2018. Her voyage ability has fallen off and her thin trait set doesn't hold her in good stead with WRG's collection push.

She still offers a few reasonable new player attributes including some fast arena evasion if you fuse her and gauntlet rolls if you don't. Despite her poor gauntlet skill set and low 2nd/3rd rolls, T'Pol still owns the top super rare DIP roll and can help young rosters get a foothold in that area until the exclusives start to trickle in. With bases unlikely to merit a thaw and poor collection potential, this T'Pol is more of a new player card than one that will age gracefully alongside your roster.
