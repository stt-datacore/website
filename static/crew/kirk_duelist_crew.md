With Kal-if-fee and Mirror Kirks dueling for the honor of 'worst variant for cost', you'll want to steer clear of both if possible. Kirk is guaranteed events until the end of Timelines and Kal-if-fee's SEC is still usable for events, but that's about where his usefulness ends. There's theoretical value in his +1 Inspiring and top 50 proficiency total, but his rolls are spread too evenly to be effective and he's not someone that's likely to crack your daily use rotation, even with stars. His best case behold scenario is against two redundant or useless options.
