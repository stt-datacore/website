A 2021 release, Captain Saru might have accidentally time traveled from 2018 - or at least his stats did. His pair of collections is the highlight here (by far), though he will catch the occasional event, if not as frequently as his Disco-inflated event count might suggest.

Saru's voyage usability is scheduled to be Execute(d) as this version pairs a bloated skill set with ugly debut power. After a run of good-to-godlike gold variants, this is one Saru you can leave on the shelf.
