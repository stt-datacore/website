She might change looks quicker than a shapeshifter at a swinging convention but the Kirstie Alley look alike here will keep working on cadet missions all weekend. Dual eligibility and two big bases makes critting them A Certain Formality.

Saavik's savvy carries over to voyages too, where voyage power around the top ten among rares makes for great additional usage for the cadet queen.

It's all hands on deck for the expanded Vulcan collection and with many low-rarity options, Saavik may help you hit the one, five, or even ten crew threshold in the early-to-mid game. Outside of a few Vulcan IDICs and lamps, she sits on the easy side of equip costs for her rarity.
