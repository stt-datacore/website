RIVA'S CHORUS: Welcome to my note, dear friends!

RIVA'S CHORUS WARRIOR: It fills me with joy that you have fond memories of me, both as representation of the deaf community and as a symbol of what it means to persevere despite tragedy and extreme adversity. I don't even mind that you sometimes refer to me as "Ginger Jesus."

RIVA'S CHORUS SCHOLAR: But I know you've looked at my stats, and the numbers aren't great. The big DIP base, while perfectly in keeping of a diplomat of my stature, will find few chances to be of much use with my esoteric trait set, and my lack of a third skill means I will never set foot on a voyage. Although, if we're being honest, even the second skill is a stretch. Do I look like a scientist?

RIVA'S CHORUS BALANCE: I know full well that no matter how much you like me as a character, in a best-case scenario I will end up in your cryostasis vault in short order. Outside of a Diplomat collection spot, I really don't have much to offer. Perhaps, if a Telepath or Cultural Figure mega pops up in the future, we shall meet again. Until then, farewell.
