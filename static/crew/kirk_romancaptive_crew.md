Learn to be fully erect with this ONE WEIRD TRICK - Chiropractors HATE him!

Despite Kirk's disappearing act in 2021, he remains one of the premier event names in Timelines and Roman slots into a huge blind spot in Kirk's skill portfolio; DIP (at least where Orions aren't concerned). Even without much trait help, this variant is a viable candidate for duping if you're a Faction event connoisseur or, at minimum, the first crew you grab out of cryo.

But before he makes it to Rura Penthe, newer players will enjoy his prodigious voyage power. Bad skill set or no, Roman offers a huge score (having debuted at #1 overall and piercing the bottom of the legendary ranks) and a handful of anti-matter traits to enable usage the mimics a partially fused gold crew. With a passable arena ability, Roman offers a little something to everyone and is elite in multiple areas.
