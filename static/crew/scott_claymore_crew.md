Claymore Scotty looks like he should really be hanging out in Madame Tussauds, and not just because his artwork looks ever so slightly off - it's because he's an ever so slightly 'bad' copy of a superior crew, in this instance, his Tribble Herder cousin.

With the TOS mega in our rearview mirror, the biggest issue with Scotty, as always, remains his lack of event viability, but with this being his fifth event in three months, he's looking healthier than ever in that regard. Good thing, too, since he's dead weight for traits. If we get a Duelist mega, he'll be a handy crew to have; otherwise, he's strictly a base and voyages beast.

This note may sound cautionary, but Claymore Scotty is actually a pretty healthy and good card in real terms. If you haven't snagged any of the top shelf ENG/SEC voyagers of the last year, he's a perfectly good way to fill that void, and it's just nice to see the original Miracle Worker get some love.
