Richelieu beware! - a usable Sulu! There's a very fine line between a "bad" crew and a rarely useful crew; Sulu is the latter. He will have chances to shine in events once immortalized and has some collection value with a little wiggle room for more. It's the fact that won't pay back the investment at nearly the rate of many other legendary crew that stops most players from investing. If you're an endgame player looking to round out your toolkit or chase collections, Mirror Sulu is far from the worst option out there, but is not a recommendation for early-to-mid game rosters.
