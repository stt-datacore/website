Amazing! Rutherford would be as excited by his Uncommon variant as he is with a double latticed thermal mesh, and if you are a new player you should be too! He’s the #1 Voyager in his rarity and his ENG base will help with some tricky early game node clearing and Cadet usage (though sadly his trait set doesn't qualify him for any locked ones). For everyone else he’s an easy Immortalization in 3 stat-boosting Collections.
