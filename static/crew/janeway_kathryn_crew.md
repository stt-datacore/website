In a height of irony DB decided to make Janeway a fairly respectable 2* Voyager (get it? Voyager...like the show, okay I’ll stop). Her stats are not going to make anyone rush to immortalise her especially considering she only fills the uncommon collection. However if you need someone to fill a CMD/SCI spot on a voyage and all your other crew are on event shuttles she’s your girl. Cadet usage depends on how much coffee you have saved up…
