Call him Delta Flyer Paris Version 2.0. As North Face Knee Brace Mayweather is the second legendary crew to have a CMD/ENG/MED skill set, the comparison is unavoidable. Mayweather's base and voyage prowess thoroughly outclass Ol' Speed Racer, with a CMD base that slots in right between OG stalwarts Commander Kira and Borg Queen to give him some spotty event work when you least expect it

But you're here to hear me gush about his voyage work. His pair of top five voyage pairs as well as *the best* skill set in the game is like popping in a couple of quarters on Paris' flashing 'Game Over' screen so that you can enjoy a few more years of voyage work from Mayweather and Paris can finally start thumbing through the Power Creep Acres brochure you gave him months ago.
