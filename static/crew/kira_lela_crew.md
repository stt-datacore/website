Hands behind her back, big smile on her face…either she’s showing off the origin of certain Jadzia mannerisms or she’s just feeling super smug about how awesome her debut in Timelines is!

Lela has Zhian'tara’d away from Jadzia’s normally dire Voyaging prospects and taken her place amongst the other top embodiments of the former Dax hosts (I mean, just look at all their VRanks!), though unfortunately overshadowed by Sisko, the Emissary in her Pairing and Triplet. If you missed out on him it’s not much of a step down to Lela, or you can field them both as a mighty 1-2 punch!

As if this wasn’t enough, her real shining value is in Collections, of which she debuts with 6(!), all of which are Stat-Boosting! There’s even a chance at two more (seriously, when are we getting the Bajoran Collection?), making Lela one of the elite Collection crew in the game. This mound of traits, combined with some decent Base scores, give her plenty of Event value as well, which is all the more reason to get yourself a copy or two if you have the time and resources to pull it off.
