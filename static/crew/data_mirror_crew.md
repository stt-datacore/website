The Mr. Potato Head of Trek characters, many of Data's variants seem to have the same solid core with just some external tweaks from crew to crew. That's not a bad thing; they're all pretty reliable and Data is too popular a name for his downward event trend to continue. Mirror's voyage power reflects his three years in the game and ENG/SEC is no longer an uncommon pairing, but he's recently picked up a collection spot to supplement his value, which is still worth considering despite his age.
