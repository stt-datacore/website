From 'Bread and Circuses' comes an old man with a sword as one of the most deadly beings in the known universe. His SEC is obviously tops for a MED focused character and may be so for a long time, but for MED or 'SEC and MED' seats it still sits behind the man who practiced one kick 10,000 times - global gift Bones McCoy. Losing that bit of equity hurts, but Faction events have never lacked SEC seats.

Beyond shuttles, his uncommon skill pairing translates to plus utility including usable gauntlet numbers with the occasional 45% crit and a top five MED/SEC pair for voyages. Once fused, he's capable of making voyage runs for you far past the 8 hour mark a la Mirror Phlox, though will never be a recommended option due to the poor overall stat total. That being said, never confuse capable for optimal, and if you see an opportunity to upgrade to a better MED/SEC option like Dereth or Fury Kes, you take it. Overall, McCoy offers strong event value, but his peripherals are trending toward helping out younger rosters only.
