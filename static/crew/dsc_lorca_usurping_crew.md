A crew you take more for cool factor or sheer affection than anything else, ‘Leather Daddy Lorca’ may be swinging around a big ol’ sword and a third skill, but don’t allow yourself to be fooled - his best base only ranks #6 between Mirror, Villain and Disco SEC crew, and he really shouldn’t be voyaging on anyone’s roster. And while the stat-boosting collection is a nice post-release value add, don’t use it as a justification to take him over better cards when you know you’re only doing it because you like Jason Isaacs. Shh, it’s okay, you’re among friends.
