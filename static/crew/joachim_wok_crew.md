Joachim tasks me...he tasks me and I shall tier him. I guess WRG never got the memo when Khan ordered “Full power, damn you!” and the result is a very red scorecard. 

Outside of an all-star 2018 that saw Joachim piloting fistfuls of events, he’s been missing in action somethin’ fierce. SEC/CMD is primo shuttle seating and his bases would still find work when he snags a bonus, but the stars haven’t aligned for that much at all. Still viable for future event and collection value, his traits are going to need to catch WRG’s favor before this becomes anything more than a crew you’re begrudgingly forced to take in a bad behold.
