The William Riker legacy. Is it that he relinquished the incredible power of the Q for the sake of his friends? Is it the way he swings his legs over the backs of chairs and women? No, it’s this big, fat DIP Base! By now you don’t need to be told that the Skill set is redundant and he offers squat in several areas such as the Arena and Gauntlet.

But Riker is a household name with Traits to spare - you can feel the heat coming off Victorian Pulaski’s cheeks from here as RiQer lines up even more of his Traits for future Events and Collections. By the end, Will will have snapped his fingers into five or six Collections and will be an invaluable Super Rare crew.
