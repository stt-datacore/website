We attached the â€œworst variant for cost" moniker to Tac Burnham for a quite a while, but her depth as a card has served her well over time. Plenty of event work (even post-Disco megas), multi-collection status, fine early game attack booster on ships...there's something for everyone here, even if the raw base and voyage numbers reveal her age.
