“This is the best day of my life!” But also his…last? No? There’s gonna be a whole Prophets thing? Can we still immortalise him in the Honour Hall though? Excellent.

On screen credentials sure, it’s a no brainer. But is this Timelines variant worthy enough of a place in the Honour Hall? Let’s fling ourselves aboard a Pakled Clumpship and find out!

Large-ish but not trademark worthy base? Traits that somehow don’t get the credit they’re due in Events? This is not a good start Papa Bear. Ah here we go, Ship Battles! Limitless 400% Instant Damage with a speedy 14s Cycle Time? There has to be a catch. Oh, there is a catch? That’s right folks, it was almost too good to be true but there it is, buried under heaps of Pakled scrap metal and what appears to be Rutherford’s implant: a Position trigger. Sadly it will be hard to find a ship with both the Cycle and Uptime available to maximise his Booms when you could just stick with the current triggerless metas. Maybe play with something like the Proton and see what you can work out?

Ok well how about Voyages? The man has Voyaged back from the dead, surely he can Voyage for you, dear player. Aha, now we’re on to something! Though not a Later Losers™ Voyager, he’s got little competition for SEC when AM seating comes into play. One of the better SEC primary Voyagers in general and still a heavy hitter when you consider Pri/Sec pairings and his Triplet, this hunk of Bajoran Beefsteak may find a place for you as a niche Power Voyager. Key word here is niche, though. If you’ve got oodles of Honour just lying about, you’re either elderly enough to have an established roster where he hardly moves the needle, saving up for a far more worthwhile Honour Sale, or both. And remember, he costs 4 Cites on top of that Honour investment! With only 3 Stat-Boosting Collections to his name, your time and resources are better spent elsewhere if that’s your angle (though Bajoran should be coming in the recent future? Far future?).

Negativity about his not-quite Honour Hall worthy stats aside, look at that art! This is a pretty bitchin’ card and an actual use of blood in Timelines! Is there hope for Stabbed Picard one day? Heroic Shaxs is certainly worthy of praise for the “nice to look at” aspects, and isn’t that what part of this game is all about? Go ahead and grab him if he’s a favourite character and you won’t feel sorry, but from a gameplay perspective there’s no rush: he’ll be waiting there alongside the other HH crew you’ve not purchased yet for when it finally feels right.
