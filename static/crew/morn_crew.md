After a long session at Quarks Morn finds out that his tab has run a bit too high and now must accept any job to make ends meet. He has very average stats for a 3* diplomat and he is easily outclassed by other available 3* crew. His one positive is that his SEC stat doesn't dip too far from his primary so his voyage eligibility has uses for getting the two hour mark. But like a Lurian slumped over a barstool, he is more disappointing than useful.
