Impressive voyage and gauntlet numbers for a one-off character. If this were a Dax or Data, she might be keeping tier 1 company. Mirror Phlox's gauntlet dance partner; she see-saws with him among the pair rankings depending on the skill and owns the highest minimum proficiency for MED, meaning she’ll be more reliable than other strong, but risky crew like Defensive Phlox. She also has more ranked gauntlet pairs than anyone not named Caretaker or Doc Crusher. If you need MED crew, she's one of the best starting right at 1/4. For voyages, she’s one of three MED primaries in the top 70 voyage totals and does well there even alongside fused legendaries. For overall daily use she’s fantastic enough to overcome the lack of long term perks that would sink most cards.
