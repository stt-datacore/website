In an endeavor to get Captain Pike’s torpedo to launch, Rigel Vina is another bit of Talosian trickery. Vina is a complete non-starter save for one area - a fantastic dress sense that might convince WRG to include her in Lwaxana events. What a shame for such enticing art to spend its life locked away in the freezer.
