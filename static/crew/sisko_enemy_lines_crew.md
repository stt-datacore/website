Two of his best attributes come from the less common corners of a card - 400% damage in the arena and two stat-boosting collections. His healthy event count and CMD base (26 points off of variant-best) are fine additions as well and average voyage numbers have a chance to find  some voyage work if you channel honor into him to finish off collections.
