Does a character without a name really qualify for the Janeway/Picard 'character look left, character smiling' variant treatment? Regardless, she's here now and not as bad as she could have been.

Voyage power that we might still recommend in a better skill set is blunted by the availability of CMD/DIP/SCI, though she could make some runs on young rosters that manage to fuse her early. There's also some bad news hiding behind an otherwise reasonable event count - it's marred by Disco domination, unlikely to be repeated. It's not out of the realm of possibility for Strange New Worlds to change that, but Picard's namesake show didn't really see a huge bump in weekend usability for those names like Discovery did once upon a time.

Four non-HFS traits is enough meat on the bone for a super rare crew and with the unlikeliest of those dominos falling first in the form of the Original Thinking collection, she could (and should) end up as a more attractive card to endgame players than she debuted as.
