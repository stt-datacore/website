Slash fiction writers be praised, it's the handsome Kirk I've - I mean - you've been waiting for! Born to voyage, Kirk can still perform there, even a few years removed from his debut metrics. His plus skill set and a few rare-for-ENG traits like Romantic should last him perhaps four to five years after his release.

Laborer's event count, like his Shatner-esque colleagues, is in excellent standing. Even with very little help from traits so far, he's still churned out faction bonus after faction bonus and could stay atop the Kirk ENG charts for a long time. If you've been mulling starring up another ENG crew to bolster voyages or shuttles, Kirk's event pedigree guarantees Laborer to be a strong investment.
