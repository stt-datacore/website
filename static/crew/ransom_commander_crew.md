Commander Ransom? More like Commander Handsome, amirite? Ok, for once we’ve been outshined by the flavor text guy which, along with his art, stand head and broad shoulders above the rest of this card.

The CMD/DIP/SUCK handicap strikes again, undermining a competent raw voyage score and half dozen anti-matter traits, which will do their best to find him occasional usage regardless. With thin value profiles in other areas of the game, you’ll be counting on Lower Decks and a few of his traits to provide you with the opportunity for extended use on shuttles.
