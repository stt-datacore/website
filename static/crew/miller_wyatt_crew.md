A Foreigner song come to life, Wyatt’s Take On Meaningful art is as integral to the plot as just about anything else in this power ballad episode and a welcome respite from the traditional Lwaxana nonsense.

Unfortunately, he’s not quite as radical on your roster. Having debuted with mediocre voyage power, his plus skill set and anti-matter traits won’t have a true chance to shine as a cornerstone voyager, but at least extend his shelf life beyond what you’d normally see from raw numbers around his level. Once dismissed from that area of the game, his usefulness drops off sharply and his absolute ceiling would be as a triple collection piece who sees a couple events per year.
