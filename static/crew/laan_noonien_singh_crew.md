Thankfully WRG first released an amazingly fun variant of La’an in the guise of Princess Thalia (and Runa) because this Super Rare variant is nearly as boring as they come.

Sure, La’an has decent voyage power for a Super Rare upon debut, but the boring top two skills of SEC and CMD don’t do much to inspire use for fledgling accounts.  Sure, the SCI tertiary is nice, but where’s the pizzazz?!

At least the big SEC base is on brand for the Pike-era Enterprise’s Chief Security Officer so that’ll help out when La’an’s traits hit on shuttle weekends, or we get a La’anevent, setting the clumsy portmateau aside for now.

For Super Rares generally you want to see 3-4 collections and as it stands she comes up just short with her debut 2, with 1 more viable trait right in the wheelhouse for a future inclusion.

Gauntlet?  Don’t use her.  Ship battles?  Don’t use her.  In short, she’s a 4-F crew.  Finish, Freeze, and Freakin’ Forget.
