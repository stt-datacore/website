One of several case studies in debut numbers, it was apparent from the beginning that this Dax was a shaky voyage investment despite the reasonable skill set. While #DaxBrand is a market leader in event reputation, this variant's thin trait set won't provide nearly as much weekend value as others and somewhat caps her potential collection value as well. Unless you're invested in the character from the show, this crew is a 'pass' more often than not.
