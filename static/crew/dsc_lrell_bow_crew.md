L'Rell boasts the best SEC base at the uncommon level, but her proficiency-lite DIP secondary may struggle with some cadet nodes given her lack of relevant traits. Without Starfleet eligibility and Thursday being the one day that many players don’t bother with Epic difficulty, her usage is more narrow than it first appears.

Still, L’Rell has reasonable, front-loaded collection value to supplement her SEC work, even if you pass on her to start your Timelines career in favor of a more flexible option or one that has a less Faction item-heavy build.
