Luck was a lady to Big Julie who picked up two collections post-haste following his debut. The first, Physician, on a technicality and the second, Costumed, happens to be the largest stat-booster in the game. Even if two of his collections don't currently require legendary crew to complete, a collection in hand is worth two in the bush and may see expansions down the line.

By way of one of the most hilarious ship ability names out there, Jules is also very competent in the realms of arena and skirmish. A +9 attack boost is as good as it gets for triggerless super rare options and it comes online fast enough and lasts long enough to sit among the premier options at his rarity.

Having gotten this far without mentioning voyages or events is noteworthy, but Bashir brings it there too. Competent voyage metrics paired with a skill order that is totally unique across rarities makes him a fine option there into the mid-game and he might be your only realistic SCI option among Bashir variants if you're not into stacking stars on the decrepit AF Bashir. An extraordinarily well-rounded crew, players should be turning cartwheels if this Bashir crops up as an event reward down the line and you manage to snag him early on in your Timelines journey.
