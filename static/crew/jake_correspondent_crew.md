Just a step behind in too many areas to be particularly strong choice. DIP/SEC is a dime-a-dozen skill set and even with a reasonably strong primary base, he's only averaged just over one event per year. His MED and eventual collection are something to look forward to, but he'll never be near the top of any citation lists.
