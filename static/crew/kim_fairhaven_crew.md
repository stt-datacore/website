Cow kissing Harry is the new age Smuggler Kasidy Yates - that one card whose silhouette remains black in cryo as you kick yourself for not grabbing him from his 6-pack and then quickly realize that the addition of a Costumed collection wouldn't have made it worth it anyways.

If you're looking for positives outside of that dapper outfit, both of Kim's bases are variant-best, though that speaks less to his quality and more to how horrid most Harry variants are (looking at you, Rogue Harry). Still, it will serve him well on Kim weekends, which have been much more frequent than you realize as he keeps pace with names like Spock and Sisko.
