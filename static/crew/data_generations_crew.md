We were allowed to serve a dollop or two more of praise up for Emo Chip Data back before Red Angel joined the game. He was a legitimate gauntlet option in a competitive DIP/ENG stack. Now he’s merely hoping to win the coin flip against her when used with a crit advantage and is only more than a curiosity in his lone 45% gauntlet.

Unless you’re a brand new player, Emo is probably freezer bound, but will at least catch a handful of events each year and has a collection profile sitting just above average. Due to his weak bases, don’t expect to use him much before immortalization.
