Rocket fueled by seven (!!!) previous megas, Tyler has accrued an unbelievable event tally. While we wouldn’t bet on a Marksman or Tactician mega, the same could have been said the same for Pilot so, really, who knows? Beyond the clumps of Tyler/trait events, he’s also one of only a few crew to offer the Pilot/SEC node unlock and ticks the box for one of the bigger collections in the game.
