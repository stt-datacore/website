Typically I, unseen author #6, like to iterate on previous crew notes and brush up things where needed, but with Yates I had to tear up the script. 

With daily use a fading memory, we'll risk being somewhat reductive in saying that the Costumed, Pilot, and Civilian traits encompass what kind of value you can expect to glean from Yates moving forward. As they hit on various events and collections, she'll become varying levels of attractive across different rosters.

But the lede, here in paragraph three as is the custom, is her spot in the Bada-Bing collection. You'll want to read up on Scapegoat O'Brien before deciding on Yates as the two are forever linked in value. As of this writing, the 🐐 is a hell of a daily use crew and worth completing for their collection. As long as he remains so, you can consider Yates' spot there as something like an equivalent 1/5/10 stat-booster if you have enough capital to see their immortalizations through.
