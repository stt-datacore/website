Behold - The latest and greatest Ultra-Premium-Deluxe Campaign reward!

EV Suit Mirror Universe Chief Engineered Rutherford has arrived and, as his name flows describing exactly what you’re getting and absolutely won’t have unnamed company change his traits and collections before you buy him for $25 USD, you can bet he has AMAZING VALUE!

Let’s get the obvious out of the way – this variant of Rutherford should not be both EV Suit, Chief Engineer AND Mirror Universe, but for right now, that’s what we’re going with.  As such, you get *five* stat boosting collections out of the gate, and daily shuttle use to boot for the new #4 ENG base.

But wait, there’s more!  Do you want a crew that is useful in Arena and FBB, and not a carbon copy 400% nuke?  Look no further friend, affording you 25% hull repair and a decent set of passives, here’s a replacement (albeit slower) for your Nightmare/Ultra Nightmare setups if you don’t have Dereth or can’t seem to retrieve First Officer Chekov.  

Still not sold? Well, what if I told you, dear reader, that he is debuting at a mightily impressive high voyage rank that absolutely doesn’t happen every week now-a-days? Useful to those who don’t have the three-week-old Tobin O’Brien or the “Rerun three weeks before” AGIMUS, your ENG/CMD Voyage seats will be kept warm by the Resourceful Human Starfleet Federation (but not Mirror Universe EV Suit Engineered) Chief Engineer Rutherford!

Phones are ringing, operators are standing by!  What are you waiting for?  BUY TODAY!
Or don’t.
You’ll probably run across an equally useful Engineering character in less than a month anyway.
BUY NOW!
