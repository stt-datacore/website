As my mother used to say “A Strong DIP Base Will Get You Far In Life” but then she was a strange woman. Whilst long term players with established rosters will probably freeze Chekov with only his bi-annual events to consider, newer players will get good use out of his strong DIP base and high performing voyage rank.

The future of Chekov is probably on the wane, however, with future events more likely to be Discovery or Picard focused - don’t be surprised if Chekov nets fewer weekend appearances in the future without a robust trait set to break his fall.
