First things first; yes, cite her last star if you haven't. Outside of her mega, Janeway will continue to perform well on voyages, shuttles, and weekends for a long time to come. She's worth the investment and stacks up well alongside the rest of the numerous ENG/SEC crew DB released in 2019. For the price of a single star, she hits on two collections including everybody's favorite Jury Rigger.

If you're coming to her new in a behold, you can expect a fairly complete package. A base/event pairing you can set your replicated watch by, bolstered by a bevy of traits tied for the most among Janeway variants, second tier ENG/SEC voyage power, and double collections. Considering the plethora of statistically weak Janeways, Determined stands out as one to target if you have too many basic coffees in your inventory.
