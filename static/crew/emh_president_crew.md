Triple collections and a handful of events are generally a bounty for the average Super Rare. But he also pitches in reasonable voyage power in the form of the always useful MED and MED/CMD. An above average DIP/MED gauntlet pair and plenty of traits makes him a 1/4 asset to new players, especially when they line up for 65% crit.
