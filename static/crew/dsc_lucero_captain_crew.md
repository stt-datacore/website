Alita arrives to kick tribble ass! Well, her inexperienced Starfleet cousin does at any rate. Purple CMD/SCI has not been the most populated pairing until recent times and it makes sense that the Prodigy Of Pike should be quite proficient in this field. Her voyage ability is the lede and she'll perform like a gold crew with two or three stars there. 

Even for Disco events she's a fine stand-in for shuttle seats and may save you from thawing a less daily-capable option, just beware of the flood of Discovery SCI bases that have her outside the top twenty names there. Her Crit Bonus ability fires off quick enough to be used with some damage dealers which increases her Arena/Skirmish viability, producing Ardra-lite results. But for Disco Faction events Lucero is more than useful. She is just a shell, not good, not bad. That part is up to you.
