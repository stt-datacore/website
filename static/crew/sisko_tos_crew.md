This anachronistic Sisko’s primary flip-flops from base to voyages, but neither is particularly effective. Between a gross voyage power/skill set combo and having no base better than fourth among Sisko variants, 1701’s best chance at usability will likely come at the helm of a requisition shuttle. He'll at least have the opportunity for those, between Sisko's healthy event clip and a handful of juicy traits.

Having chewed through half of what we figure to be his potential collections, his value there can certainly be a behold tiebreaker. Despite his low power level, the value of traits should carry enough water for his name to pop up from time to time and shouldn’t be the last name on your list to help finish the very exclusive Tribble Trouble collection.
