Over thirty events for an Archer?! What is this, the Mirror Universe? Actually, yea. 

Even though some might consider certain traits 'tapped' for future megas, M’Archer does have a few viable traits he can call on down the line to “highlight” a pair of flaccid bases for your requisition shuttles. He’s not close to daily use and may not even merit a thaw for many users, but minor collection value gives him universal appeal and CMD/SEC dominates event seating.
