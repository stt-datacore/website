When Loken debuted, his ranking anywhere above, say, a ham sandwich had almost everything to do with the ENG/MED part of his skill set which was in short supply. But thanks to a 2021 trait audit, Loken picked up three new traits, one of which went on to become the largest collection in the game at the time. While those three traits didn't seem the most eventable or collectable at the time. Resourceful's over-performance in value goes to show that nothing can be taken for granted.

With a base that ranks as usable across his trait pools and even some cloak-triggered arena damage and lower end voyage ability, Loken is more well-rounded than he was at the time of his debut and has held up in value over time.

By the way, we have Ham Sandwich around tier 8. Solid whole wheat base will make some shuttle runs when bonus, but few condiments limit his voyage and event potential.
