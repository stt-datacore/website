Most people feel that Pah-Wraith Keiko's #1 base CMD is unearned. I would argue that the besmirchment of Mrs. O'Brien's good name that is this card is similarly unearned. Okay, she's not quite that bad - Mirror (5) + Keiko (1) events, a competent voyage total that includes the sometimes rare CMD/SCI, and +1 Vanity mean she isn't completely irrelevant - but she's certainly nowhere near good. Freeze and forget for anyone but the newest players.
