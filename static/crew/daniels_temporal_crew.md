Oh Danny boy, I guess the whole “good stats from the future” thing only worked out for Braxton. The oldster in the rocking chair would remind you that Daniels actually held the top SCI base spot for the better part of a year, but he couldn’t repair the power creep timeline and as a result has become a relic himself. Until both of his viable traits become collections (and even then…) he’s not worth your behold capital.
