Let us read from the book of Kor, chapter seven, verse seven; “Savor the fruit of life, my young friends. It has a sweet taste when it is fresh from the vine. But don't live too long. The taste turns bitter... after a time.”

Oh, it will feel wonderful getting your hands on that top five voyage score and oversaturated art. But every (weekly) CMD/DIP/SUCK crew to come out will infect the joyousness of your lives. A mere 29% chance to find a seat for one of his two anti-matter traits? Not at all pleasurable.

We prefer permanence. The reward of skill sets that endure and grow stronger with the passing of time. If you were to send Tuvok to look at the Trajector-y of similar paper champions of the past, it wouldn’t end well. Hot Wheels Jameson, Ideal Male Body Demos…not exactly multi-year instant cite material.

Gath’s eclectic trait set (there’s never been a politician obsessed with pleasure before, has there?) may work a bit better for collection possibilities, but he’s starting from behind there and will need to get lucky just to pull average with the field.

But hey, something something ‘absolute power absolutely’. He’s got the goods on day one to be a repeat customer on your voyages and shuttles. Just consider this a warning about what will likely be a brief return on your investment. If recap packs are good to you, enjoy using him early and often, but he won’t be earning my citations and maybe he shouldn’t be gobbling down yours either.
