Well, it happened. Anson Mounted a Pike comeback, resulting in several Pike event bumps since his introduction in Discovery season two. With the silver fox locked in for another Trek series, this OG pike variant will have his chances to sword-n-board his way onto a few more weekend shuttles, despite bad bases.

His usage/power is too poor otherwise except in the arena. A combination of +10 attack and fast activation is not particularly common and would be fine for ship battles if the cost to fuse him wasn't so high.
