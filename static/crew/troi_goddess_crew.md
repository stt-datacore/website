We always welcome eventable traits alongside main cast characters. The Hologram mega may have passed, but has also had a few standalone events. With a DIP that's tops for Troi events and 2nd among Holograms, she's a fairly effective event crew. The occasional 65% crit to pair with a MED roll just outside the top 10 in the gauntlet gives her a bit of extra daily use.
