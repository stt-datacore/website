Imagine Ardra was actually a six foot android with heuristic learning systems and the strength of tin men. Ten, sorry. As a “variant”, this Data may be boring as sin, but he’s eminently usable.

Evergreen Event work with a fistful of playable Traits should see Data’s extremely reliable Event history continue without interruption. And his strong ENG/SCI Base metrics come in a package far preferable to the likes of JG Palmer for overall usage. With a Voyage score still viable today, Data should see usage all over the field and should make for some very clever Bridge Crew photos.
