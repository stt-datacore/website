Well, we haven’t reached legendary status for Boimler, but at least his cards are improving. Tragically forced to square dance at gunpoint, Cowpoke parlays his fearful Do-si-dos into real day one usability on voyages and shuttles. More interesting for late game players will be a worthy trait list to line up a series of collections as well as future event thawpertunities.

Despite the green light ratings, most of Boimler’s uniqueness comes from his collections, so new players needn’t feel obligated to chase yet another CMD/DIP/SEC if they don’t have resources to spare.
