Having cut his teeth in the gauntlet, Gorignak has been somewhat rudely excused from there, first by the mega crew Surak and again later by gauntlet reward Armus. His top five SCI/CMD pair is still a boon to newer players, but he's as likely to face 40% win chance walls as any other crew.

Excellent CMD/DIP/SCI voyagers have flooded in from multiple angles, making it one of the most populous skill sets which all but puts Yarnek to bed there too if you're a long time player. Formerly offering good utility for a one-off, there's not enough power left in Rock Lobster's tank to make him worthwhile to anyone but younger rosters.
