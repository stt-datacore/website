Spock variants rarely miss and, true to form, this avatar of Leonard Nimoy's inner poet is more sweet spring wine than bitter dregs. Platonian is what you've come to expect from Spock; a quality trait set, clockwork event bonuses, and voyage ability (think a slightly better Locutus).

As a handy upgrade from the aging Kolinahr variant, this variant fills an exploitable niche for events in the form of some sorely lacking Spock DIP. His (awful) DIP rank is not the typically coveted 'Big Base' offering - nevertheless Spock and his accompanying traits provide enough weekend bonuses for him to pop up as a strong shuttle option throughout the year. While not a cornerstone crew, Platonian is the kind of faceted card that every roster should look to be stocked with.
