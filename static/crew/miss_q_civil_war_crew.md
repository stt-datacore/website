All Belle, no ball, Miss Q stinks a bit of filler card, though we might need to chalk that one up to the lack of Civil War-era showers. She's not yet out of gas on voyages, but soon will be with unimpressive power and an easily obtainable skill set. Without regular bonus work for her satisfactory DIP base, Belle sits as more of an emotional behold choice who can justify the pick with intermittent use on shuttles and voyages, but is objectively bested by many other names.
