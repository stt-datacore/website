One of the better super rares to come out of the Dominion mega, it’s fair to say that Goldmember’s sister is an example of how super rare crew can easily outstrip their legendary equivalents in terms of a return on your investment. Tertiary MED, a six second Attack boost, spirited Gauntlet pairs, and overall fair event potential keep her from falling into the same doldrums as her legendary equivalent.
