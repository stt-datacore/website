His event contributions look usable on paper - the #1 Riker DIP with SEC just a few points off of FO Riker for #1 in that skill too. His Vulcan trait (#5 SEC) along with several others offer additional future chances for him to showcase his talents on the weekend. Considering his dreary voyage, gauntlet, and arena power, he's best thought of as a luxury 2-skill event choice.
