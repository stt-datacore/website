Rather like an inferior cover band of a superior artist - or, to put a little more bluntly, a slightly unwelcome second variant for a character with only three appearances - Priestess Siranna may have a higher voyage rank than her less spiritual counterpart, but for skill set, she contributes less, and very little that's unique outside of a small chunk of early game CMD/MED and [_potential help unlocking the Quinn node in episode 10_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Into_the_Cave). While she may have been grandfathered into a very healthy event count, we're about reaching the saturation point when it comes to Discovery 4* crew - by this point, unless you're scraping the bottom of requisition shuttles every time a mega comes by, you simply don't need this many to stay competitive, especially not when there are Disco 4* in the portal that offer better bases, collection value and event versatility. For early rosters, she'll temporarily salve a MEDical emergency, but you'll be moving on to better crew soon.
