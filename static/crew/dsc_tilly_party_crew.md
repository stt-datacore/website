If you don't love Tilly, steer hard aport. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the rash of Discovery megas, Tilly's weekend usage predictably tanked after they ended and she's been gasping for air ever since. With traits pointed more toward voyage anti-matter or a bit of flavor, she should continue to be a disappointing event name with a backwards-looking event tally and settle in alongside the Scottys and Sulus of the game.

Unfortunately those aforementioned anti-matter traits are crowded with dozens of better voyage options in most cases. A poor skill set meets poor power to disqualify her from making runs until a MED Tilly joins the game and you put together an all-Tilly voyage on a lark. Between arena evasion that can be outdone by super rares and low probability collection traits, Tilly is an easy skip if you're wise, man.
