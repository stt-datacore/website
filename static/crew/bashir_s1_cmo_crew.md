Impressive collection value is the main draw for Rao Bashir who, despite his bevy of traits, offers no galaxy map node unlocks. A combined MED score punchy enough to help out with cadet missions does get limited help from bonus traits, but as a lowly, lowly cook common crew, feel free to hold off on leveling him until you get over the early game trainer hump.
