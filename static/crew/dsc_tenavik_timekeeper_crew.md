Sidling up to the renowned First Officer Burnham, this Timelord siphons her reputation as if he were living on Planet M-113. A reasonable approximation, Tenavik offers fulsome base and voyage power, trading in her variant event history and rock-solid ranks for a spot in the Klingon collection. His SCI base isn't just great at differentiating his skill set among his angry brethren, but also gives him the top SCI base for that trait and any future Klingon events.
