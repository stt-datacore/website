If the oft-lauded Costumed Mega Event seems like a long time ago, it was!  Two years later, even the incredible Human Saru and Klingon West are on fumes for Voyages, so it would stand that the inferior-on-debut Xahean Adira is even worse off… and they are.  Their skill set does them no favors; competition exists there from all angles, including a handful of former Mega Recurring Legendaries, Campaigns, global giveaways, and the aforementioned powerhouse crew like RSK and Human Saru. 

Event futures for Discovery crew remain murky even given their resurrection in late 2022, and the end of the TV show after Season 5, but the Adira character has practically kicked the doors in to signal their arrival with three quality Legendary variants in short order, two of them coming from Event features.  Xahean Adira has found themselves in three Collections and has one more viable Trait, but topping out at four Collections makes them a compelling Crew Retrieval candidate once you’ve exhausted the top options with 5+ inclusions.
