Seamus only asks for a shilling or two, but you're better off tossing a coin to your Witcher. The Story of Seamus begins and ends with his traits. Perhaps overperforming in the past for events and underperforming for collections as of this writing, he offers some value in both areas, though nothing is guaranteed from this card and it may take a while and more than a few pints before he becomes attractive to endgame players.
