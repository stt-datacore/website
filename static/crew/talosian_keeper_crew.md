A fugitive from Easter Island, this encephalitic enigma does a great job delivering in the areas that a one-off should. Keeper's huge SCI roll pairs with a respectable MED to keep him from butting heads with previous gauntlet exclusives while delivering voyage power that punches above its numbers with a useful skill set. His unique lineup of traits helps augment both areas while also affording him occasional chances at weekend relevance for a dash of added value. The surface numbers don't wow, but The Keeper remains a great chess piece going into his third year, especially on younger rosters.
