The advent of a new card that can cover the event bases of two characters at the same time is almost always a time of great excitement here at the Big Book. Unfortunately, Spock as T'Pring falls prey to a classic Treehouse of Horror blunder. 

"Take this uber campaign crew, but beware, it is cursed so that only one of its characters will ever get event play worth talking about!" 
Ooh, that's bad. 
"But it comes with a new #1 Spock DIP base for events, and some SEC/SCI!" 
That's good! 
"DIP/SEC/SCI is only one step away from CMD/DIP/SUCK." 
That's bad. 
"But you get some non-standard traits that could get future collections and events, like Interrogator and Spiritual!" 
That's good! 
"The power level of this card is such that you should get two years of use out of them, but they aren't truly elite in any way and will struggle to stay relevant on voyages outside of that SCI kicker and Vulcan/Telepath AM seats." 
. . . . . . . 
"That's bad."

Yes, you can go now.
