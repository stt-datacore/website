Is one of the finest admirals in the fleet a good choice for voyage rosters? That's a stupid question. Surprisingly our augmented savant here is a top choice for CMD/SCI voyages, that is if you don't have that field already well crewed. Although he beats the likes of Tenavik and FO Burnham for the top spot in the CMD/SCI leagues his overall usefulness is negated by a middling ship ability and less than useful event numbers. Two 1k base stats will get him work on shuttles should he not find room on an already crowded CMD/SCI voyage. Should you not have FO Burnham then Patrick is an adequate replacement, just don't expect him to pull too many event bonuses.
