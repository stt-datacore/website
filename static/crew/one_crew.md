Two 1k bases never performed so badly. Even if another Borg mega was guaranteed, you shouldn't invest five stars of behold capital for a crew who offers nothing day to day. A Borg faction and mini-mega early in 2019 should have piqued some interest in their future, but as a to-date performer, One simply falls flat. If you select him because of his wonderful character and episode, cross your fingers for more Borg event action.
