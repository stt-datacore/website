An odd juxtaposition of some laughable attributes like her painfully thin trait set and some big time perks like dual cadet eligibility and a premium collection. Given her lack of name brand and mediocre bases, it's easy to skip over her as an option in the early game and surely she's not a must have at first.

But if you can stomach the build cost of a few dozen plates of Gagh and Klingon House Crests, she'll do okay covering DIP and SCI on a handful of weekend nodes and is a name you'll need to immortalize sooner or later to stack stat boosts on your way through one of the largest collections in the game.
