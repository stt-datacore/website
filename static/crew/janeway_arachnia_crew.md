Arachnia hasn't deserved the title of 'Queen' for about three years now and with honors like 'worst CMD/DIP/SEC voyage total', you should know what you're getting into before she skunks you with her pheromones. She owns the #3 Janeway DIP base (respectable for its age), which has poor chances to flourish through trait events, and a vanity collection spot. There's still some value to be gleaned from this aged monarch, but don't expect any daily use.
