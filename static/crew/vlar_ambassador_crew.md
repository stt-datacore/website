Not to be confused with that blowhard V’Las, let's start with the most interesting thing about Ambassador V'Lar. Namely, the fact that she was played by an Irish actress with the absolutely incomparable name of Fionnula Flanagan. Just take a look at that name, ladies and gentlemen. Damn. Fionnula.

Unfortunately, that and a tenner will get you a Big Book patreon subscription #Sellout. If you’re not utilizing her Ardra-lite arena ability, V’Lar joins hundreds of crew outside the realm of daily use whose usability and value hinge on traits. With middling collection and event bonus futures, this card is as good as most other low tier behold options for padding out your stat-boosting collections and filling weekend shuttles when she catches a bonus.
