If you share Kirk’s delight in seeing the ol’ stovepipe, your roster is either fairly new or fairly old. Abe’s somewhat competitive Proficiencies are bolstered by a handful of nice Crit Gauntlets and can be used there from star one, especially for fresh rosters.

On the flip side, his quartet of Collections with the possibility of adding one or two more may have him earning a few impulse buys from discounted dilithium packs or Crew Retrieval. There’s not much in between as he’s otherwise bereft of usefulness, but still being able to make a dent in multiple areas is far better than the majority of 2016 crew can claim. 

TL;DR: four Stat-boosting Collections, attacks racists.
