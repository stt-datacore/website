MED/SEC/SCI. Lieutenant Watley definitely knew a stud when she saw one, and 1701 Bashir, sporting an appropriately dweeby haircut, qualifies. Though his voyage rank won't impress, that's actually pretty par for the course for almost everyone with this skill set. 

Don't believe me? Defensive Phlox, Twilight T'Pol, Fury Kes; all of them pretty 'weak' voyagers relative to the new CMD/DIP/SEC hotness - and yet, in spite of that, you'll always find them punching above their weight class precisely because of how rarely these skills are found together. 

Tempering Bashir's potential are his Chad older brothers, Captive and RAF Bashir, whose superior MED bases shove 1701 down the shuttle ranks and steal his lunch money - but when it comes to MED primary cards, you can never have too many.
