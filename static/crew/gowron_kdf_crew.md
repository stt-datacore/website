An abysmal crew in all but one area - new players avoid, veteran players embrace. Two of the tougher collections in one package makes him a must-take at some point in your Timelines journey, but he's so wretchedly bad elsewhere and expensive to build that you shouldn't feel obligated to do so until later on in your gameplay. Don't bother thawing him for events unless he's the featured crew.
