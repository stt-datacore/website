Formerly an all-star at the super rare level, the game has since seen plenty of the base/voyage/event triad types, pushing top shelf crew to have something extra on their résumé to stand out. This Burnham does not. Still a vaunted event name in Timelines, Prospect offers early-game voyage work with the requisite number of stars, but little else. With the Discovery trait drowning in SCI bases and her ranking outside of the top twenty there, you can at least take comfort in knowing that Burnham variant chances will never slow down.
