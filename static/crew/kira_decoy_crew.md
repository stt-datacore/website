Don't get distracted, let's cut to the chase. We know what to expect with Kira variants; some combination of CMD/DIP/SEC and a steady event count. And, despite the name, Decoy is mostly the real deal. Drawing comparisons to event sensei Zhian'tara Odo, she betters his daily contributions at the cost of some of his weekend potential. Players have been campaigning for Romantic or Costumed megas for some time, but with their bonus pools ballooning into triple digits, Bajoran remains her best bet for extra event bonuses.

She offers little elsewhere outside of a potential future Badda Bing/Vic Fontaine vanity collection, but what's here adds up to a crew that will never let your eyes wander too far away for too long.
