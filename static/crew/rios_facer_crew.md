Just ludicrously lush art, which is likely what you wanted him for anyways. Several gold chains, rakish red hat, the hide of some sort of green animal draped over his smoking jacket. Rios is telling you, “I missed him by *that* much.”

Having debuted with pretty mediocre voyage power, Rios is already in the twilight of his abilities there. A few less common anti-matter traits may save his skin from time to time, but the game has also seen several superior DIP/ENG-type names added to the game in the meantime. With fairly thin (and mostly theoretical) event and collection potential, it’s probably now or never if you want to get much use out of this stunningly stylish crew.
