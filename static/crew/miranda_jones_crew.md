Pre-Pulaski smoke show Jones has a reputation beyond what she's earned. None of her numbers are even average and DIP/SCI is not hurting for representation. One of only four traits has activated weekend usefulness (Vulcan) and it's hard to see that happening many more times. If you want her for her gorgeous, tantalizing...dress, I won't argue, but as a Timelines card, she lacks much of an impact.
