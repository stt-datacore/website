What do you picture when you hear the word Agnes? Someone old, someone not quite with the times, or perhaps someone cursed with a name that makes them seem like they're destined to live to 89 and have fifteen cats, am I right? Well, Ms. Jurati bucks that image quite handily, showing an excellent grasp of what the people want - and that's Cheesecake Seven.

Now, I would never dream of saying that she can come close to that leviathan's impact, but it's a name worth mentioning, regardless. Scoring two stat boosting collections (that might be expanded soon, ala Diplomat), a unique skill order for super rare crew, and a half decent voyage score that she will outperform, she even has a relatively bankable event future thanks to her firmly established place on La Sirena.

Will you freeze her? Eventually. But it'll be a long road, getting from here to there - and while you're traversing that road, this cute as a button, capable of murder (twice!), brilliantly unique card will be at your side long after you thought you'd need her.
