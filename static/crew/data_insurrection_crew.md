Data's variants in Timelines are a fascinating study. They're both quite similar and yet Rock, Paper, Scissors at the same time. Having looked at what each offers, Pinafore stands out as one of the best. A #1 variant ENG, usable CMD, and ENG/CMD voyage work that only just slid out of the top ten at the very least have him near the top of the pack, even if he's missing the trait benefits that a handful of others have. Data's perennial event work should rebound from a slow 2019 to buoy otherwise unimpressive stat ranks. Close your eyes and throw at a dartboard of Datas and you'll never come away disappointed.
