Ro is a bit of an odd one. Her CMD stat starts with a high Base but she is easily outperformed by other crew members by having a poorer proficiency. She can however work in all the Cadet Missions, has a hefty +4 Attack score for Ship Battles and is one of the easiest crewmembers to equip. Worth keeping around as backup for Sito on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Enduring value for her includes her one non-Rarity Collection and a Bajoran Trait waiting to be baked into a future Collection.
