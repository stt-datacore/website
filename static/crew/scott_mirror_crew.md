Worthwhile though it may be, no card can really do justice to Scotty's heroics on [stardate unknown], where without his impeccable power balancing and, presumably, cross-circuiting to B, we may not have had a happy ending to the episode which launched a host of hokey and cherished Mirror Trek episodes.

Mirror Monty is fairly mid-level across most of his attributes. An average skill combo with good-not-great power puts him in play for voyages in the early-to-mid game, but he's not a standout. After an Archer-esque event drought to begin Timelines, Scotty has settled in as a steady, low-output event feature with an, again, average base for those weekends.

Boosting his otherwise viable power levels are a pair of collections, including Smoke and Mirrors which has perhaps the most repugnant options at the legendary level of all the collections which still require a gold crew to complete. Monty will be a mandatory immortalize for players looking to avoid paying out massive honor levies to crew who are best left unpicked on the begold screen.
