Lefler's trait album is littered with singles that are just too crowded to get any event airtime down the line, which handicaps a respectable ENG base. The lone exception, Innovator, did pop in 2019, though it likely provides better value for its collection spot. In the arena, her weak active ability has her behind too many other options to register on the value radar and undercuts an interesting and otherwise useful initialization time.

The base and voyage numbers are there in a vacuum, but in the tree ring slice of our current timeline, her near clone, Safecracker Nog, was just available from an event, while you'd be looking to fuse Lefler from a 6-pack. A character-driven crew who will hurt for impact opportunities beyond the early/mid-game.
