A portion of Qorbin's future value will depend on whether or not de Lancie's biannual events get extended to the whole Q family. If not, speculation about event futures of the three-traited man is pointless and he remains entrenched as a voyage-only piece.

Q2 attempts to atone for the lack of anti-matter traits with a skill order that's not particularly common, even if the overall skill set is held down by two previous mega crew and a gauntlet exclusive. And in the gauntlet, his two weak pairs may disappear from the rankings before the ink dries on this note. He'll perform fine for daily work, but has almost no chance for significant long-term impact unless he gets lucky with events.
