Spocks and outrageous event histories just go hand in hand. Even if he didn’t debut with a top ten base (he did) or have a primary skill that shows up on over 30% of Faction seats (he does), he’d still provide a mouth-watering number of Faction Action thawpertunities.

The rest of this card doesn’t disappoint either. Worthwhile voyage numbers with a SEC/SCI pair that can be hard to stack at the legendary level, a fast attack boost on ships that newer players could utilize, and a mid-level collection profile. With top notch art from the Arm & Hammer poster boy, this is one prisoner who you shouldn’t let escape.
