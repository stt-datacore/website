I had to zoom out the spreadsheet just to find her competition for base CMD; you may even notice a few 5/5s below her whose primary she bests. Surprisingly, she's not the top CMD voyager, but having the only secondary-or-better MED in the top 80 CMD means she fills that particular niche wonderfully with solid totals to boot. Her daily work is among the best in the game, but she won’t catch regular events and boasts no collections which dampens her desirability a bit. Thankfully, Kes’ lone event feature was alongside the popular Killy in a faction event which would make for a delightful rerun.
