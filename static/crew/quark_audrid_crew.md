The entity that lent me this body wishes to write this Big Book of Behold Advice crew note.

Long-awaited has been this Zhian'tara mega and therefore long-awaited have been all of the Deep Space Nine characters who were inhabited by the former hosts of the Dax symbiont.  Perhaps one of the most amusing scenes of “Facets” was when Audrid Dax, a female, compassionate former host of Dax possesses Quark, which Quark finds perturbing at best.

So we find Audrid Quark with an unusual cornucopia of traits, including combinations never before seen such as Trill + Ferengi and Trill + Caregiver, making Audrid eventually an easy Crew Retrieval.  These traits also buoy the crew’s long-term utility, with 3 out-of-the-box collections and 3 more viable ones.

With a common skill set, only four antimatter traits, and lower-than-usual debut voyage power, Audrid may not find a seat often on an elderly roster, but is serviceable on perhaps the average player’s set of voyagers.  The Ferengi antimatter seat may be their best chance to hop aboard.

Quark does get a decent number of events and those aforementioned traits give Audrid a chance to get some weekend work when not a variant bonus and they’ve got the top Quark CMD by almost 400 points.  No gauntlet or ship utility really to speak of though, but you might not want to miss this crew since there are so few Ferengi with possible daily use!
