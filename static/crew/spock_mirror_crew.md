Mirror Spock has four areas of value: Events, Collections, Ships, and Fleet Boss Battles. Let’s explore!

Events: He’s Spock, with a large number of additional Traits to add to variant Event bonuses. You’ll scarcely have time to Freeze him before his number gets called again. Collections: Three including the tough Mirror Universe set, and Traits to see him stack up to two more. Solidly above-average, heading towards the elite. Ships: a Big +9 Accuracy Boost at an immediate 1s Activation can give your Ships in Arena or Skirmish the chance to hit hard and fast! Fleet Boss Battles: all those Traits give Spock the ability to hunt those Nodes and solve them for your Fleet. 

Easy choice in a Legendary Behold for this Emperor.
