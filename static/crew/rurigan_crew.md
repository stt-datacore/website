Rurigan - noted voyager who hadn't left his village in thirty years. Robust surface-level metrics ensure strong daily use performance for the aged Yaderan and while relying on traits for event work can lead to streaky shuttle opportunities, Rurigan has had fistfuls of bonuses in the years leading up to his debut.

Four of his five relevant traits appear for anti-matter seating on voyages and leave some room for his pair of debut collections to expand down the line. He's one of the safer non-'bridge crew' investments out there.
