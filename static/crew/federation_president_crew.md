A good comparison crew would ironically be Chancellor Gorkon whose primary base and voyage numbers are both within single digits. It stings a bit to see a gaping hole where his event chances should be when he's carrying such strong bases, but at least they're plenty usable for daily shuttles.

Rigatoni's "real feel" voyage power may disappoint slightly as a DIP primary with his skill set, though he's only behind the Chancellorific tandem of L'Rell and Gorkon for his skill order and so the raw stats will shine through once fused. With a redundant skill set and no events or peripheral perks to look forward to, try not to be [blinded by the stats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcWVL4B-4pI) and think carefully about how much of an upgrade Ravioli would be to your current CMD/DIP/SEC options.
