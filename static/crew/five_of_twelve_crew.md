Father Time is doing some work on Five's voyage outlook, but despite a common skill set and power creep doing it's thing, Five remains a competent voyager with a clutch ENG tertiary to slow his descent over time ala Wrathful Kirk or AoS Riker. More interesting is a CMD base which beats out the ballyhooed Borg Queen for the #1 Borg CMD, even if only by a bit. And his SECondary is just a few points out of #2 for Borg crew as well. Collections don't usually sway the value of legendary crew much, but hitting two of the tougher ones at once can be a consideration on certain rosters. ST:Picard may perk up Borg weekend work while the ultimate deep-dive exists; a possible future variant event for the Dream(y) Axum.
