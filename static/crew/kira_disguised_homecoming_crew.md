A respectable event count and #2 Kira DIP give her some weekend value, but for daily shuttles, you shouldn't need to look too far to find better. Her top 10 SEC proficiency is the likeliest avenue to daily use even if it results in zero ranked pairs and isn't likely to claim many wins at high rank. She's the legendary sister of so many super rares you freeze and thaw between events.
