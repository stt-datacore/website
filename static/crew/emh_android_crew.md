A true all-rounder, EMA runs the gamut from starter crew to late game anchor. Let's start with two of his underappreciated attributes for the newbies - triggerless (slow) arena damage and some gauntlet maneuverability. Four 45% gauntlets and a ton of elevated crit gauntlets overall join up with a gorgeous skill set to give him coverage over two of the rarer skill pairs and helps him snatch a few 2-for-1 wins for midgame rosters.

His juicy skill set/trait combo carries through to voyages where he punches way above his power level and has aged and will age better than almost any other crew. He's the only legendary MED primary to offer both SEC and CMD and supports it with a half dozen anti-matter traits to write his own ticket for priority seating.

In one of his few weak spots, Doc variant events have been a wasteland for Faction action over the past several years. While his slew of traits have helped supplement that, MED seating can be hard to come by and so he will rarely ride shuttles without a bonus. Those helpful traits (Gee, it's almost like traits matter) also grant him multi-collection status with room for more. He should be among the first names you immortalize for every one of them.
