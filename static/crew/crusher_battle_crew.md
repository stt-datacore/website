Guns Blazin’ Bev, Blastin’ Battle Bev, Cartoon Cannon Crusher....you get the drift. Listen, if you were a secret mom for 24 years and someone was trying to kidnap your secret son, you’d turn into Rambo just as fast.

OK let’s get the obvious out of the way first – yes she looks like she debuted in Star Trek: Picard: The Animated Series. Yes, she traded her trademark red locks for a more weathered dark/grey look. Yes, she’s a ‘Doctor’ with no MED skill.

Visuals aside, Crusher storms into the game instantly as the best representation of Gates McFadden we’ve had in years. Further crushing it will be the *eight* Voyage seat matches in her crosshairs, in an otherwise crowded skillset – especially from the power creep releases over the last six months. Bev is also a 400% boom in Arena, albeit behind a boarding trigger.

That’s where the upside drops, as she debuts with only one Collection and, while there is hope for four more potential ones, Bev may find herself in a cryo-tube before those days come. If you find yourself in a fire-fight with other players during an event to earn a copy, you probably won’t need reinforcements – well, not until the rest of her family show up.
