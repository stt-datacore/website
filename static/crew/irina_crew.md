Irina had a truly serviceable run as voyager whose name was on the lips of many for ENG options, but was never going to stay on top without the “later losers” top five kind of power that kept other crew relevant for years longer. Still, this is where we’d put the “Not dead yet” scene from Monty Python if we had hyperlinks ;(

If you’re a few stars in on this crew already, no need to abandon ship quite yet. Owning several low competition anti-matter traits, she will pop up for voyages occasionally on the average roster and has a better collection ceiling than most cards. She’s less valuable to players looking for a fresh investment than most new releases would be, but does offer a little bit of 2-for-1 gauntlet potential at one star when her traits align.
