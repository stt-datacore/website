Boy, losing that Cetacean Biologist trait really torpedoed Annie Camden. Well...her retrievability at least.

Taylor isn't a crew you're looking to stack stars on in a hurry anymore. Her voyage work is old news, she doesn't get events, and her best daily use attribute is available from star one. Despite owning few elevated crit gauntlets, Taylor has some impressive proficiencies for a super rare and can be worth the behold capital if you have other retrieval priorities early on in your gameplay.

Her other daily use spot of note is as arena evasion. +9 is a nice boost, though we'd like to see it activate a hair faster and last a bit longer. When you do end up fusing her, the lone physician collection spot will toll and should remain the last one she's ever credited with.
