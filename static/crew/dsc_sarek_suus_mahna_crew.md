His numbers don't jump off the page and aren't even average in many cases, but Sarek's trait rolodex and smattering of series appearances have caused him to collect a litany of event chances. Owning two spots in collections that were expanded in 2020 help offset a voyage score resting in the dumpster and the presumable loss of blanket Discovery event bonuses. Slow, but strong, trigglerless arena damage should find use on most early-to-midgame rosters and help round him out, offering a wider array of value to various rosters.
