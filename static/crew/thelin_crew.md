A veritable TAS explosion hasn’t really provided much value for this Chad-chinned blue skin, but at least a couple of Collections have finally perked up the value of a crew in Thelin who was, and still is, in dire straits.

Long ago a daily use option (Ok grandpa, you’ve told us this story already), Thelin is anything but these days and after laying an Event goose egg in four of the game’s first six years, you’re going to want to see at least another Collection or two before you feel good about taking him over pretty much anyone.
