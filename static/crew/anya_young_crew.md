We can’t imagine why WRG would have chosen young, attractive Anya instead of short, old, wrinkly Anya, but here we are. Lacking voyage power and with a low ceiling to her collection and event potential, Anya is a card that new players might want to take one star on just for her arena damage. If her ability in that area of the game is redundant to you, then so is Anya. At least until you’re elbow deep in hundreds of packs muttering “Look at the Rozhenkos’ collection potential!” Get some help, friend.
