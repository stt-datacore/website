First off, let's all take a moment to appreciate the best crew name this game has ever produced. Fetishists rejoice for a tier 1 name. Her bases are a game of good news, bad news. They're great by the numbers - two over 1100 and both variant-best. But Bev has never exceeded one event feature in a calendar year. If we dig into the big bag of traits, 'costumed' or 'physician' may trigger in the future, but she'll likely have to settle for very sporadic weekend work.

Voyages are a reverse story - a disappointing total that will often be eclipsed by new crew. But all permutations of her skill set are low on options, meaning that she'll regularly catch a ride over better ranked crew. With some tweaks to her numbers, she could be a megastar. But as power creep catches up the field and not her event count, she's more of an interesting crew who has the potential to stopgap multiple holes at once.
