Kes’ totally non-standard trait set is rather wonky for events and node clearing, but works just fine for collections. As one of few cadet choices for a couple of her traits, she’s a fine early game immortalization option to boost that area.

But that’s burying the lede - her dual weekend cadet eligibility is a great way to stretch your trainer value and lets you crit almost all MED and SCI nodes available, with a bit of luck on your dice rolls. With several other attributes in tow that can find niche usage in the early game, Kes is very well-rounded for a 2-skill crew and a good choice to level up early.
