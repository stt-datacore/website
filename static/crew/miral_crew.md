The Commandant rarely grants crew reprieve from the Pit of Despair, but the addition of the honorable Klingon kollection has given Miral a morsel of value. Itâ€™s likely to be her only blip on the radar until the end of the game so feel free to pass on her until your other behold options are fully fused.
