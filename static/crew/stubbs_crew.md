Hey, champ, what has two thumbs and is totally forgettable? Paul Stubbs. How ya doing? The best we can say is he will be fine as a warm body on a Skirmish ship. Beyond that, SCI and ENG are the bacon-and-eggs skill duo of any Trek scientist-of-the-week, and a handful of nondescript or overloaded traits mean his chances for post-mega work are pretty slim. If you do choose to freeze and forget him, he will nab a spot in the Daystrom Award collection, if you need it. Think of it as your reward to yourself. For patience.
