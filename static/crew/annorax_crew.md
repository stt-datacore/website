Much like the civilizations he's erased, Red's time as a top ten SCI/CMD voyager is beyond most people's memory, and in real terms, if you're searching for a comparison to a more common crew, he's more similar to Armus on voyages, without the gauntlet prowess. If you're looking for shuttle help who can pitch in elsewhere, he's not the worst investment thanks to several potential future mega traits, but it's a game of chance and you're playing with some hideous stakes if you lose. If Annorax is unlucky, you're looking at ever-sinking stat totals without much else to buoy him.
