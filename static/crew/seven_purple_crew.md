No, Honey, I was listening. But I can’t this weekend, my mother is stopping by to visit us. Why are you looking at me like that?

Folks, be glad that you’re not the one she’s glaring at. The newest model in fusion cuisine, Fury Seven combines with a pricier legendary crew (Mobile Doctor) to form a unique and powerful five star Seven/Doc. As a standalone super rare, Indignant gets a few events each year and is more often than not worth the thaw for a mid-game player. Add in her collection spot and a few other vaguely collectable traits and you have a super rare that you'll probably circle around and immortalize once her older sister is done.
