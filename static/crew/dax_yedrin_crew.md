Jeez, Sisko, every behavioral expert on any two-bit True Crime drama will tell you looking down and away is a sign of dishonesty. Maybe if you’d listened to those on audiobook instead of Les Miserables, you wouldn’t have been duped.

Grandfathered, or rather Grandsonned into a heady Dax Event count sees Yedrin starting off on the right foot. His string of Traits have further supplemented that tally in recent years and should continue to do so as WRG pairs Trait Collection with Trait Mega Event time and again. As his number of Collections rise to meet his weekend usefulness too, we should see Yedrin hold value in the future.

But don’t overlook his immediate day to day potential either. Decent Voyage power grants him day one usage for early-to-midgame rosters and makes him a well-rounded crew. This may not be the Jadzia or Ezri power refresh we’ve been looking for, but Dax is back with this offering.
