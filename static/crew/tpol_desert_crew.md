Still fairly well rounded, T'Pol is a worthwhile option for Voyages, Events, and Collections. When she inevitably falls from usage on Voyages, which should happen around the time the proverbial ink dries on this note, consider a prodigious Event history littered with a few Traits that seem to have caught WRG's eye in the past and may again in the future. Those Traits have also made her a multi-Collection piece with a small avenue for value expansion in that area.
