Crew with a trio of event features are usually worth snagging at some point, even if featured alongside the likes of Anij and the Grand Nagus. If those are the sorts of crew you’re looking to collect or you just want the good ol’ 500th strongest voyager in the game (there’s no door prize for that), Harris is your man. One or two traits may pop for future weekends, particularly Section 31, but he’ll need several more Galaxy features to pay back whatever you’d spend to level him.
