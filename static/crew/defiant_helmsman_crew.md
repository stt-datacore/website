Like our good buddy Vargas, former 6-packer Wyatt checks all the wrong boxes for crew. Not main cast, poor traits, two skills... His notable avenue for value, arena instant damage, has become little more than an eyebrow raiser as Wyatt joins armfuls of other crew who fill the same role at eight seconds or better; many without Wyatt's trigger restriction and easily available from crew retrieval.

The right skill pair for shuttle seating means that if you can follow a Borg sphere through a temporal inversion back to 2018's Pilot mega to plug him into a shuttle for a few days, by all means. Otherwise, leave this one to the collectors and head to the forums to complain about the degradation of the prestige of legendary crew.
