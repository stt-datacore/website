Bat’leth gives MED, flask gives ENG…write that down, write that down. Not nearly as meme-able as “I LOVE HON-OR” from the same scene, Flask Mariner is stock standard in more ways than one.

Competent but not interesting on shuttles and voyages, Mariner’s power level is right in that recurring mega sweet spot where new players shouldn’t regret their decision to immortalize her (thank God she’s not CMD/DIP/SUCK), but Elder players may benefit from more narrow crew (Boss Battles Scotty?) who address a specific area rather than being above average in a few as Mariner is.

While Lower Decks characters will see some variant event work, WRG seems gunshy on further show-themed mega events so a lot of Mariner’s collection and event value will be hit or miss moving forward.
