Four event features and a handful of other Tucker/trait weekends should provide a couple thawpertunities each year. His daily use chances are what you would expect from a 2016 crew, but a second post-release collection gives him plenty of behold screen value for veteran players who aren't looking for daily contributions from their super rares.
