Cap’n Miller has the honorific of owning the lowest base of any super rare - 200 DIP. And he took lessons from Judge Q on how to turn a big proficiency total into some mediocre gauntlet pairs. But Chakotay events are picking up (relatively) and this variant does have a trait smörgåsbord for future mega action, including having already hit on one. No promises that any of them trigger in the future, or that Chakotay doesn’t retreat to his event slumber, but if you need a reason to roll the dice in a garbage behold, the handsome American GI may prove thaw-worthy.
