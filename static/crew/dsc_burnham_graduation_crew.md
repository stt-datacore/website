Long ago touted as a "daily use" crew in this space, Graduation has been power creeped out of that usefulness save as possibly some early-game arena accuracy. She remains "just" a shuttle-filler, but with Burnham and Discovery dominating event work since their arrival to the game, she's undoubtedly one of the best in that area.
