“Hands up, don’t shoot!” generally means a SEC primary ‘round these parts, but it hardly matters what skills Quark has with numbers this poor. Usable in a single area, event shuttles with a bonus, Quark’s rancid bases will be looking for small bonus pools or early-to-mid game rosters in order to compete for shuttle seating.

That being said, if either of those criteria are met, perhaps you can cash in some value based on his prodigious and remarkably consistent event history. In concert with a mid-level collection profile, you’re looking at a card who isn’t special by any means, but should beat out plenty of dead end behold choices.
