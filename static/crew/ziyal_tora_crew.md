Two 'usable' bases puts her near the top of a couple different traits' 'best of' lists. If/when they crop up, she'll be a valuable weekend resource, but until then she's almost a total dud of an investment. She may pop up on a few voyages out of necessity for very new players due to her MED, but will fade into obscurity in the mid-game and beyond. If you select her as a character choice, you'll be hoping for a Cardassian or Bajoran mega, like the several other racial events that have come before.
