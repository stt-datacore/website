Top 1* CMD stat with a poor SEC score won't be putting him any lists anytime soon. CMD/SEC is an extremely common pairing so you will no doubt have someone better. His ship ability might get some use with a +500 crit rating but don't expect him to help in the Arena. No extra collection bonuses means you can move him on or find a superior bearded version.
