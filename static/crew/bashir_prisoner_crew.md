Captive's respectable event clip is propped up by a couple previous mega events, but there's a little wiggle room for more trait action. And the Bashir character has been prone to event droughts, to boot. All this is to say that his Faction usability may stop and start, but he sports plus event potential overall, particularly if you routinely pass on any of his handful of mediocre legendary variants.

Of more interest are double collections and excellent voyage potential. MED/SEC is an uncommon stack and a good power/trait combo as well as the best voyage MED this side of Mirror Phlox suppliment the skills well to give him better staying power than almost any other super rare voyager. The occasional 45% gauntlet presents minor one-star opportunities, but Bashir is more event (and voyage) focused than his MED gauntlet counterparts.
