Base and voyage numbers are fairly usable for newer players, but he contributes nothing else. It's not hard to see another repeat of his event, perhaps giving you an easy way to snag a star, but going by his traits, that's the upper limit of his chances at relevance. He's not so bad that a star advantage wouldn't give him some use on the average roster, but if you select him it's because he's mother fuckin' Frasier Crane.
