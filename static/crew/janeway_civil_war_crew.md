I know that you're probably asking yourself, why would a brilliant, handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny little bipedal specimen like Janeway? The answer: collections.

Despite a med-led skill set, Janeway’s power level doesn’t cut it for most rosters and her trait set is littered with duds. But the juicy combination of Resourceful and Costumed sees her included in the two largest stat-boosters in the game and therefore a fine, if middling behold target while you’re working on collecting them all in the midgame.
