In an alternate universe Sutra teams up with Pussy Galore to run surveillance for the suave British MI6 agent Felix Leiter as he cuts down Oddjob on his way to foiling Auric Goldfinger's plot and the bumbling American agent James Bond causes countless international incidents. Well, I guess some things hold true in any universe.

In our universe, Sutra is primarily collection fodder with an outside chance for growth in that area. While event work will be trait-dependent and inconsistent, her traits have paid off in spurts thus far and that tiny, hidden Picard trait may bear fruit down the line, even if it doesn't enjoy the terrorizing run that Discovery did. With SEC and CMD seats littering Faction shuttles regularly, she should be worth the merits to thaw when the opportunities arise.
