It's a shame that the scales aren't tipped in favor of Rain's dual 1k bases which, to date, have not snagged a single event bonus. If the numbers were shifted a bit, they could push a #6 SCI/ENG gauntlet pair past even the freakasaurus Caretaker. Alas, she remains a competent voyager who, if starred up, should have no problem taking over daily shuttle duty from super rares. Just don't expect any surprise mega work out of her frankly putrid trait set.
