If you’re eyeballing Captain Planet, you’re either a very new player, a very old player, or are banking on high waisted belts making a comeback. Orion’s two attributes of note, gauntlet and arena, both point toward young rosters and are good introductory offerings.

Long time players will scoff at a twelve second activation on ships, but triggerless damage in a strong amount is just peachy for skirmishes or more defensive arena setups and most importantly will save you a retrieval in the early game while still helping to address that deficiency on your roster.

More broadly appealing are a set of proficiencies debuting just inside the top twenty in overall power. In the mold of Lara and Prophet Kira who came just before, Orion is similarly SEC/CMD oriented and tops out at 25% crit in any given gauntlet.

For veteran players, Orion may merely be a once-in-a-blue-moon gauntlet pick and string of traits, but hey, they’ve already got *your* money bwahahahaha.
