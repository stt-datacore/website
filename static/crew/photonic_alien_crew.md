Worthwhile daily numbers on debut are always welcome for crew who don't have variants and their characters' events to fall back on. Invader has a window of voyage use for newer players thanks to a SCI/SEC stack that can be tricky to flesh out at the legendary level and should put in work for the first year or so after release.

A substantial SCI base can also pitch in on age-appropriate rosters and would pop big with an event bonus, but Invader is living mega to mega and will need his traits to align to make a difference on weekends. The highlight for children of all ages is his collection value headlined by the large Costume Party gang. Multi-collection pieces will seemingly never go out of style and are your week to week event mementos gathered to eventually help boost crew power at the legendary level.
