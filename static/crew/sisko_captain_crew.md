CO Sisko is not a tier one crew, but the copy you get from achievements will be your only one, so we here at the Big Book want to make sure you're aware of that before tossing him out in the cold. If you've already done so without realizing it, a friendly ticket to customer support might be able to help you out.

As a standalone crew, he's mostly a notch on the Inspiring collection with some pinch hitting arena accuracy that you should be able to upgrade out of before too long. Two competent (read:not huge) bases are okay in the early game, but won't merit a thaw for events down the line and his voyage power + skill set combo doesn't register on the radar.
