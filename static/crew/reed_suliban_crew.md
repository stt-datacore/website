Poor stats across the board means he's not suitable for your typical daily work. Outside of his lone 45% gauntlet, Balok and others will slap him around with ease, though he can play stepping stone to help a fresh roster climb the gauntlet ladder.

Reed's event work is equally unreliable and he sometimes just drops nothing burgers over the course of entire years, even though a few untapped traits may help smooth things out in the future. Until he becomes a multi-collection piece, he's an easy avoid for any player except those who are brand new and find him in a behold against some all-time bad choices.
