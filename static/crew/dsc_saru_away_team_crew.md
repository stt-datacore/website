It’s been quite the fall from grace for AT Saru who didn’t debut with beaucoup power, but had a nice skill set niche and the Discovery mega freight train powering his weekend work.

Now a daily option no longer, Saru needs those event bonuses to keep rolling in for him to have a chance to justify your behold investment. He has indeed done well in the few years following the fall of Disco thanks to a helping hand from the Exobiology trait, but on balance he sits on the low end of your typical aged event/collection combo pieces. It’s alright to add stars if you have Saru already, but don’t go out of your way to acquire him.
