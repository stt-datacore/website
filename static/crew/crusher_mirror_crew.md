Bev offering to repair your ship's hull twenty (!!) seconds into the battle? She is Troy Barnes delivering pizza.

Relic of a bygone era is apt in this case. As Brooks would say, "The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry." You can add voyages and gauntlet (at least for established players) to the list of areas where she used to be alright too. So what is this Bev good for?

Well, an eclectic trait set has saved many a crew and although they can't magically give her modern proficiencies, fresh rosters can plug-n-play her gauntlet work from time to time. And Bev's event count would be on life support without those traits. As with most crew this age, consider Crusher for her collection and event value with anything else as a bonus.
