In brief; purple Species 8472. Cosmo collected a trio of distinctions upon release - Best SEC proficiency, best SCI proficiency, and best gauntlet pair among super rare crew. Snagging all that with a single star would be a massive boon for younger rosters and he may even make it into the shuffle for your starting five into the midgame.

Yet for veterans, those bullets might ring hollow in practice. His gauntlet pair happens to be one of the more competitive combos with names like Gary Seven, Armus, and ATB floating around his SEC/SCI power level. Add to that a trait set which produces no crit gauntlets above 25% and the lack of a third skill, and you start to get a feel for the sort of ceiling this almost-good-enough gauntleteer has.

If you're in a situation where Cosmo could be of use for you, by all means take the low-risk, single star investment and enjoy pushing around someone's Locutus from time to time. But with almost nothing else noteworthy in this card's features, he's Cosmo Kramer: the ass, man.
