Not to be confused with older sister First Officer Burnham, this variant is a step down, but base-y enough to find use. Her voyage numbers are south of the equator for 3-skill crew and CMD/SEC has never hurt for options, but her strong shuttle metrics and Burnham's inevitability should find her enough work in that realm.

Beyond that, it's just about collections. Her traits vacillate from obscure to inflated, but a few have hit already and a few more may yet. EV Burnham is still a ways off from "Ugh, I guess I'll take her" territory, but lacks for utility or unique offerings.
