We'd like to work in a "carrying the mail" joke here, but the truth is UPS Archer is unlikely to deliver. CMD/DIP/SCI is a bloated skill set and despite some nice anti-matter traits, Archer doesn't have the supplemental power to push him into contention on voyages very often.

Surprisingly, one of this Archer's relative strengths is events. Always the black sheep Trek Captain, he's not often a featured name, but at least has rebounded from a no-show first few years of Timelines to earn a couple bonuses each year with traits to puff up those numbers.

Naturally, collections are the hot topic around the teapot and Desert has perhaps the most effective traits of his gold level counterparts. A collection count that could improve, niche arena usability, and occasional weekend relevance makes beholding Archer a reasonable outcome, especially against poor or irrelevant options.
