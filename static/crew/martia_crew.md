Move over B'Elanna, we have a new definition of volatile. Martia erupted for three consecutive mega events in mid-2019 to tredecuple (I looked it up) her event count and has historically been an all or nothing event option from year to year.

Her trait mélange, which should include Brutal for the build cost, may have room for even more, but with aged bases, this Brady Bunch star is almost purely a collection consideration. Everything but Chamelod is on the table and a six collection ceiling is absolutely peachy for mid-to-late game players utilizing dead end beholds as an opportunity to work on stacking skill boosts to pump up their legendary pieces.
