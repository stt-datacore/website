Dozens of Events wringed from four Traits (and one invisible one) is unbelievable and has made this one-off, nameless crew more relevant than he has any right to be. We would have bet at any point in the past that it wouldn't have continued and still affirm that - I guess we'll see if he continues to beat the odds.

There isn't much else noteworthy besides his three viable Traits. Should they all land on the wheel of fortune (can't capitalize that or we'll have to pay royalties), he'd be a more attractive Behold option, especially to veteran players.
