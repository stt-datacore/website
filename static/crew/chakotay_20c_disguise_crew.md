Better than the other 4* Chakotays by a wide margin - not that there's a wealth of choice - this very chic man-about-town sports a top ten voyage total that's considerably more impressive than his somewhat baffling slicked down hairstyle. Was 1996 just like that? His 4 events are a little woeful, but he makes it work.
