It's not fair to say Crell isn't event crew. All five of his traits have been event bonuses that have combined for a respectable total and his MED base for those traits rank pretty highly. That combination of event frequency and efficacy is more potent than many supposed "Bridge crew". Though known as a gauntleteer, his relative power there has dipped tremendously and the best of his three ranked pairs is rated at only 72% of the #1 crew. He still has some value when his traits align, but he's much more of a throw-in as your fifth crew than a powerhouse.

In the arena, his massive crit values activate quickly enough to compliment several damage crew and he's fine as a slightly slower Ardra if you'd like to free her crew spot. The base and voyage ranks may be reaching depressing territory, but his versatility is still there and makes for a nice one star (or more) starter crew on newer rosters.
