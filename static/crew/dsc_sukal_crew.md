Wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin' for Dusty's bases to hit on something. New players will plug Mr. Noodle's big DIP base into their daily shuttles immediately, but everyone else will need his spartan trait set to provide an event pop.

When it does, he'll certainly merit the thaw for many players, but Su'Kal is fairly bereft of utility overall and has a hard cap on just how useful the waves of trait-based megas and new collections can make him.
