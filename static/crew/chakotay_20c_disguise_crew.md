Don’t judge a card by the haircut his mom gave him when he was six (was 1996 just like that?), or maybe do. Chakotay is already forgettable enough for some, while yet another CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set isn’t doing anyone any favors on voyages. But the man for all seasons has a nice, eclectic trait lineup which should see his collection count grow and helps keep his event tally moving while WRG fawns over nuTrek characters.
