A daily use powerhouse on release, the Bug is certainly less impressive these days, but has held up better than most crew from that time period.

Still the top voyage score for his skill set as of this writing, Bug's anti-matter traits do hamstring him to an extent, but he should remain viable there for another few years. The other half of his daily duo, "big bases", have simply been power crept on established rosters, though they're close enough in real world efficacy to closely approximate the top names.

We should maybe be grateful that Bug's stubby trait list has provided a few collections so far, but for optimists there's a little room for growth there, especially if you believe the Resourceful collection meant good things for the likes of the laughably large Desperate trait pool. Better than most from around his release, but still old enough to not stand out amongst new releases, check his current power level rather than relying on others' retelling of his work on their roster over the last several years.
