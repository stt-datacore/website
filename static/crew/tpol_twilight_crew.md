Think Defensive Phlox. Down arrow inside of the gauntlet, up arrow outside of it. In the rock, paper, scissors world of dice rolling, it doesn't bode well for Twilight to see Pufferfish Phlox ranked ahead of all of her gauntlet pairs, but he's not generally a crew you'll meet walls of. T'Pol's a crit-dependent rotational piece for established rosters and a big boon for newer rosters or those who don't own all of the gauntlet's premier MED options.

Outside of the gauntlet, she's a step up in our comparison. On the wrong side of voyage power, she shouldn't be making many runs any longer, but has a strong event tally and nice run of multiple T'Pol events each year. The traits that have helped afford her that bit of usability also give her room to bloom in the collections tab. Even without the gauntlet power, T'Pol has enough going for her to make stars two through five worth snagging in beholds.
