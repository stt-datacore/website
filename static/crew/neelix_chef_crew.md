A frankly abominable card, except that he also happens to be outrageously valuable in the collections department. Part of three huge groups for which he’s essential until the end of the game, Neelix’s build is also very light on faction items, meaning any roster can knock him out during the course of a skirmish and reap the stat boosting goodness for years to come. If you’re trying to decide between immortalizing him or airlocking to save the crew slot, go with the former if you have the chrons for it.
