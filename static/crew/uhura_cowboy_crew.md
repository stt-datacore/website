In chapter five hundred thirty-seven of "Traits Matter", we'd like to cover the case of Gunslinger Youhura. We all knew that anything other than top shelf, elite power backing good ol' CMD/DIP/SUCK wouldn't last and now that Uhura's not a daily use consideration any longer, it's up to her traits to do the heavy lifting and boy have they.

Already one of the best collection values in the game, her traits support even more. She has one of the clearest paths to seven collections, which seemed an absurd idea to even entertain before WRG's seismic design shift toward a 'card collecting game'. She's legitimately a consideration alongside other crew who you'd be able to use on voyages or gauntlet, though perhaps for not that much longer.

If you're of the opinion that collections will take care of themselves and 'I love Glinn Damar's trait', then Uhura is only an event piece, albeit one whose ratio of trait events should improve and give her shuttle-friendly skill set somewhere to play.
