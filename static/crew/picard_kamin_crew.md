Kamin was something of a breather during a period where WRG released gold Picards at a clip exceeding three per year with a handful of them being top ten voyagers. Perhaps predicting that this version from a fan favorite episode would sell well on its own, Kamin wasn’t granted any absurd power notes to have players drooling to obtain him.

It may sound elitist to say that Kamin is on the wrong side of desirable for voyages considering a raw score rank still in double digits as of this writing, but his skill set is more populated than most players realize and the essential spice to separate crew in crowded skill sets, traits, sees Picard with but a single anti-matter trigger. If the legendary crew on your roster consist mostly of mega and campaign names, Kamin should still find work for you, but he’s not a competitive long-term prospect for established players.

What young rosters might also appreciate is Picard’s reasonable proficiency power. Again, he’s not a competitive late game option and his poor traits limit the number of times he shows up to work with elevated crit values, but as a one star proposition, there can be use there for folks with few of the top options. 

The bulk of Kamin’s lasting value is going to be Picard and assorted trait event bonuses. His limited, but reliable event history should see him grabbing a few bonuses per year and help soften the stat blow if you’re looking to acquire him for sentimental reasons.
