Okay, so you have several choices with what to with Mr. Vulcan here. You can level him up and immortalise to use his #10 SEC base stat and fill out a slot on the Vulcan collection. Or keep him at level 99 and fuse with him Ambassador Neelix to make the mostly-average Tuvix. By himself Tuvok will be a handy SEC crew for Sunday cadets and his skill base will make it on a voyager or two. Keep in mind that if you have a collectivistic tendency then you might be keeping a few copies of him on standby.
