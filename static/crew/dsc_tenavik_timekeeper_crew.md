Sidling up to the renowned First Officer Burnham, the Timelord siphoned her reputation as if he were living on Planet M-113. “They’re almost identical and you get four stars on him for free.” Well, who’s laughing now? Nobody, as it’s not a particularly humorous situation.

Tenavik carried the flag for players admirably through the COVID era, but with most of his daily usage now under quarantine, is there still value here? Unlike Burnham, the Klingon cashed in a few extra collection chips, vaulting him higher up possible retrieval and behold lists for endgame players. While he may not see as much voyage and shuttle use as the mutineer, a pre-loaded collection quartet is a fine consolation prize and keeps him in contention as a ‘sometimes’ behold pick.
