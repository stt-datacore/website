Ah right, that one Ensign from that…episode…show. A 24th century Redshirt, Kaplan skips the tension building on your roster and shows up already dead on arrival for convenient cryostasising. The hero trait seems to be her only likely chance for value via events and a second collection, leaving her out of a job the rest of the time unless you’re a brand new player looking to staff some shuttles day to day.
