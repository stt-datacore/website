What do you get when you take Five of Twelve, remove his Borg implants, demote him from Legendary, buff his Ship Ability, swap around some traits, and then shift him to the Lower Decks universe?  You get Axum!

.....wait, he’s not from Lower Decks?  You mean he’s supposed to look animated?  Well, I guess getting ghosted after six years will do that to a guy.  Ohhh!  He’s character #396 to join us from the excellent Unimatrix Zero two-part Voyager epic, I knew he looked vaguely familiar.  Guess I didn’t recognize him without my glasses...or my eyes.

Holding a Bat’leth and preparing to risk it all to end the Collective, Axum joins the game and rosters as the next “Super Rare card you get in a Galaxy and freeze three weeks later” offering.  Sure, he’s got great Voyage potential for new rosters or players under the punishing thumb of Nightmare Mode ™.  Even more so fresh players or those purposely locked to the not-so-fine things in life could garner some use from his position-triggered accuracy buff.  One day, you may even find a shuttle seat for him in the long awaited Romantic Mega 2 – Double The Love, Double The Pain!

Realistically, most players will level him and freeze, getting another notch in the ever-growing Borg Collection, which is where his true value shines.  At least in cryo-sleep, he can dream of Annika peacefully, instead of going through his routine existence wondering why is he still there, just to suffer?

COMPLY.
YOU WILL PARTICIPATE IN EVENTS TO EARN THREE COPIES, AND THEN FURTHER THE COMMUNITY GOOD TO REWARD ALL COLLECTIVE MEMBERS WITH THE FOURTH.  YOU WILL THEN FREEZE THIS DRONE AND RESUME YOUR DUTY STATION. DO NOT RESIST. 
END TRANSMISSION
