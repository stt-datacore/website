Over twenty events wringed from four traits (and one invisible one) is unbelievable and has made this one-off, nameless crew more relevant than he has any right to be. Continuing that trend is his post-release spot in a stat-boosting collection which requires you to collect every eligible super rare, including this one. Voyage numbers still on the right side of usable makes him worth grabbing from events if possible and building slowly via beholds for his premium collection spot.
