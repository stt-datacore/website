This one hurts. Oh, and for the record, the Big Book doesn’t just mean the abrupt, senseless, and somewhat narratively unsatisfying (albeit still emotionally resonant) death of one of Strange New World’s new characters - it means the handling of both this card, and the wider Honor Hall as of late. In times of old, the Honor Hall was a place for crew that were unique, powerful in nearly uncontestable ways, and appropriately iconic. As time has gone by and new crew have joined its ranks, the shine has come off just a little, and you’re essentially spending 100,000 Honor for crew who were just mediocre enough to disappoint you when they appeared in a six pack or event.

Hemmer, alas, is no different. Right in the middle of a stretch of ridiculously overpowered voyagers, during an Honor Sale no less, WRG dropped a pig of a card in the Hall, seeing fit to garnish it with only the faintest of lipsticks. A somewhat underserved skillset continues to underserve here, only barely shoring up lesser loved traits like Hero and Telepath with a rare non-CDS crew - but for how long? If you were to tell me WRG was going to drop a crew with this skill set with actual power in an event not a few weeks after this card debuted, I wouldn’t just believe you, I’d say, “Well, yeah, duh.”

This is the unfortunate side effect of a period of all time bangers - your audience notices ever more acutely when you drop the ball. Especially in a time where Beholds and cites are flying thick and fast, the prospect of having to manually add those four stars to Hemmer feels like a long, dark, teatime of the soul - and for what? +1 Andorian? 

I hate to say it, but even duds like Lissan or Ushaan Shran seem like better value than this, because you can at least retrieve or luck across stars for them - Hemmer will only ever be a lodestone around your neck, guzzling citations, just so that you can stare at the admittedly impressive art; and that’s assuming you keep him unfrozen for very long, given his lack of Gauntlet, ship ability, or any other real daily use. Don’t weep for him, friends - weep for what could’ve been, and what will be, if you allow yourself to be kidded into believing this is a good way to spend Honor.
