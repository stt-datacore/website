As her art might hint at, there's far more to the Intendant than meets the eye. CMD/DIP/SEC or not, her voyage numbers are still useful, even if they're a couple notches below her debut. The base numbers might not look great, and they aren't, but her top two are second among Kiras whose considerable event count is joined by Cardassian, Klingon, and Mirror traits to make the Intendant a Tuvix-like fusion of several possible future event bonuses. There's no huge stat number to point to, but with the requisite number of stars, she's a name that will come up more often than you might think.
