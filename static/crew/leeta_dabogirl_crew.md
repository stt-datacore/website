Okay, stay with me here, this girl has the lowest DIP primary stat of all the 2* crew, but that doesn’t matter. There’s only 70 points between her and the best in terms of base skill and Leeta actually has a bit more use. You will use her for certain Cadet Missions much more than you realise and she actually has a fair amount of daily use for a 2*. No collection mind but like her 4* mirror counterpart will up your crit rating in ship battles to something nice and destructive.
