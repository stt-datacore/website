This is what happens to all those New York City sewer rats when you let ‘em grow too big. Master Shredder will be tearin’ it up on your voyages for a Big Book Guaranteed™ minimum of four years post-release and likely longer thanks to her #1 overall power debut and…wait a damn minute. This crew isn’t CMD/DIP/SUCK?!?

Players still clutching their vrank #300 Pollards like dribble-stained baby blankets have a new plushie to play with. Not only is Vedala’s power profile clearly outstanding, but the CMD/MED niche which has saved many of our other toys from being tossed aside ensures her at least some level of voyage potential when her power hits a point that would disqualify other names. The only snake in her boots is a poor anti-matter hit rate, but…dude! A #1 overall CMD/MED voyager!

What her traits lack in direct anti-matter bumps, Vedala makes up for on the back end with global stat boosts thanks to a quartet of collections on release with the legitimate possibility to expand that count in the future. There are obviously holes to this crew in other areas of the game, but they’re merely heated bucket seats and big cup holders. If you cite for performance, this is a day one, four citation magnet who will pay back the investment long after our pack purchases have put WRG’s kids through college.
