Sporting a dizzying #1 voyage SEC, Colonel Wai Lin's overall voyage total lags only behind Torchbearer Voq, riding at #2 overall, and has an event count that ticks all the right boxes, including Section 31, Mirror Universe, Discovery . . . she's everyone's favourite Empress (sorry Hoshi), even bringing a potent 200% instant damage ship ability to the table. The only things holding her back are a vanilla skill set and as-of-yet unrealised event potential, but check back on the latter as we get further into 2019. This #4 base SEC is a card worth taking home to meet your mother. Just make sure you're cooking ganglia that night.
