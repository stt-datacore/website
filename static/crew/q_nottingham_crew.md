Vash's captor is unlikely to claim much daily work, but a 65% Gauntlet set with a respectable CMD roll and strong Bases among variants ensures that he's usable a few times a year, if nothing else. 

The tree rings detailing the history of STT's transition to a card collecting game are never more visible than they are here. The wheel of Collections (now off its axle, barreling mercilessly through homes, destroying families and lives) has run through half of Q's potential Collections and may even claim the rest as victims before it's all said and done.
