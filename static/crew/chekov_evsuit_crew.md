With shuttle and voyage metrics leading the way on this Chekov, he's a card that newer rosters would ideally like to see as a featured event crew that they can fuse several stars at a time on. Chekov's events (and poor traits) are scattershot at best, so a player doing the slow fuse one star at a time through beholds should be focused on his collections.

Extremely lucky to grab spots in the EV Suit and Resourceful collections (which Nobody had on their Bingo cards beforehand), a Tactician collection would be a humorous way for him to pick up the hat trick, but at this point we should just be grateful to have a relevant Chekov and gladly snag his multi-collection value where possible.
