It’s been a long road, getting this version of Phlox from his very first appearance in the Star Trek Universe to here. That’s right, before we learned about his love of Chinese food and a penchant for studying the human endocrine system, he was merely (working at) Starfleet Medical Phlox.

Well, straight from the Interspecies Medical Exchange into service alongside Starfleet, it makes sense that he’d have some Voyaging in him. Quite a strong Voyager, in fact, especially if you don’t have Doctor Kovich already on board. He’ll be sure to ride many a MED voyage and take his turn in many others thanks to a nice mix of traits and that aforementioned MED, which is naturally his Primary skill here.

Said MED is one of the better ones out there, but don’t expect to find much use for it on your Daily Shuttles unless your situation there is dire, as those seats aren’t nearly as plentiful as the others. What he will take a seat on, however, is your FBB lineup! That’s right, we have a new king of the Instant 25% Hull Repair, ready to take his place amongst the Meta. A Laborer Kirk clone with a higher Accuracy Boost and better passives, he’s only possibly matched by Honour Hall Uhura, but without the same investment. Competition for someone like this could be fierce, but if you miss out be sure to keep an eye on his entry to the Portal, as he should be a mainstay for ages.

Also of note, because we are the Big Book after all, is his four Stat-Boosting Collections. Should the fine folks at WRG ever see fit to give us Romantic (and a February Mega with the same theme?), that will probably top him out at a tidy five, which would be a fine bonus to this handy crew.
