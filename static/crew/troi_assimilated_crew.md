One of Troi's therapeutic traits caught a bonus to close out 2019, but it's her more assimilate-y buzzwords that have supplemented her weekend value thus far. With a half dozen-ish traits viable for event bonuses and/or collections, it’s reasonable to assume Troi’s value will hold steady in those areas for the foreseeable future.

New players will look more toward the gauntlet and voyages for her help. The confluence of big crit trait sets and lack of MED/SEC options may find Troi joining a new player’s gauntlet rotation (very) early on or, more likely, their voyages. Workable power and a plus skill set compensate for Troi’s lack of anti-matter seating. Legendary options will outclass her eventually, but if you manage to fuse her early on during one of WRG’s infamous CMD/DIP/SUCK marathons, she may earn her keep longer than you’d think.
