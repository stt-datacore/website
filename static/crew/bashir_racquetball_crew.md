Looking like the front page of a men's sportswear catalogue, Racquetball thankfully has a bit more substance to him than that. Due to some fantastically controversial parenting, Bashir's nonhuman tag grants him Sunday cadet work if you're not so keen on the 1-skill MED wonder Dr. Selar and can't find other female *and* alien MED options to pull double duty.

Bashir's cost to equip is rather expensive with a high chron cost sandwiched between a smattering of Faction items and super rare components. But with four stat-boosting collection spots at the end of the rainbow, you'll want to immortalize him sooner or later. Worthwhile Voyage work, including ever-valuable MED, will help him pay off an early leveling process and some strong (handicapped) arena evasion rounds him out well.
