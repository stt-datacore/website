The arguments to be had about the exclusion of this Barclay from Holodeck Enthusiasts while recovering addict Commander Barclay gets in is a conversation for the ages - long after you've fully equipped, leveled, and frozen this beloved/unloved card. Middle of the pack bases and sub-par voyage power mean that poor Cyrano is limited to stop-and-start Barclay events, or perhaps as an early-activating evasion option who might run out of gas while your ship is still being pounded.

Beyond thin chances for 'real' use lie a trio of collections to promise value to Pinocchio for years to come. This is a fine low end behold choice, but is low end nonetheless.
