Kasidy's value heavily rests on her Saturday Cadet mission eligibility where she holds both the #5 CMD and SEC bases. She's not the ideal early-game leveling target for that as she lacks in almost every other area, but if she has a star advantage and can help you clear those nodes, you may not have another option. Just make sure that your replicator is warmed up to answer the call of the 43 Faction items needed to fully equip her.
