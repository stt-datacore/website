One has to wonder if the Prophet saw his slow slide into rocky Beholds coming, or if that one caught him by surprise. As it is, he’s still a fine event piece, holding the #1 Sarek/Mirror DIP, and bringing up the rear as the #3 Vulcan DIP. And dual stat boosting collections that would otherwise require investing in much worse cards give him a long-term value that many arguably better cards wish they could boast a year from now.

He’s not much of a voyager, given how often CMD/DIP/SEC voyagers come an average player’s way (seriously, you should see the tree they grow on), and a lack of Gauntlet prospects may make you grimace when you see him in a Begold, but quick firing Arena EV and being one of only a few crew to hit 40+ event bonuses mean he might just make a difference on your roster. Just make sure to temper your expectations, lest a salvo of photon torpedoes from the Emperor’s flagship come along to ruin your day. Believe me, happens more often than you’d think.
