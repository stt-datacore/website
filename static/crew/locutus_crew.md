It's absolutely incredible that this early 2017 card is still as effective as he is. Let's start at the collections tab, where he makes you question your citation priorities. While Loco does have a leg up over other exclusives in that you can obtain a copy from achievements, he's probably one of the better dupe candidates from the exclusive crew. If you're particularly unlucky getting golds to drop from the gauntlet and are lusting after his exclusive collection spot, don't sweat finishing him (after 20,000 gauntlet rounds) as he's currently a 10% chance to drop from gauntlet - a number that only decreases with each new exclusive crew.

His wheelhouse remains the gauntlet where only he and The Red Angel own two #1 ranked skill pairings in crit-neutral situations. A massive DIP proficiency is the best single roll in the game and is often boosted by a half dozen frequently seen crit traits. His unique arena ability (one second attack boost) can allow some skirmish shenanigans with fast-activating damage crew and shave a lot of time off your weekends.

The elephant in the room is clearly a set of poor bases. Though not at Gowron levels of disgusting, they're bad enough to be mistaken for a super rare, even at 5/5. His opportunities are fairly frequent thanks to Picard and trait weekends (not to mention his namesake TV series), but he'll perform noticeably behind the top ranked crew and has more variant competition than any other character. Thanks to his uniqueness in several areas including collections and the arena, he's arguably the most well-rounded crew in the game and still retains elite gauntlet power.
