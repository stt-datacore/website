There's a general rule of thumb when it comes to the truly elite crew, and while it's a slightly unscientific method, it still stands the test of time. When it comes to crew, can you look at them, and see tier 1, without having to think about it too hard? If you have to think about it, they're not tier 1. When it comes to Medic Reno, we did have to think about it, but it was a harder gut decision than most. Beating out Caretaker, the legendary Cheesecake Seven and the old faithful Leonardo da Vinci to become the new top dog MED/ENG voyager, Reno manages to out-do them all, backwards and with heels on, Ginger Rogers-style, thanks to the ultra rare MED primary, ENG secondary pairing. She also comes bundled with a number of side benefits that make for a compelling overall package - a #4 ranked ENG/MED Gauntlet pair, two stat boosting collections, a hearty MED base, and a collection of traits that may not pick up many megas, but will definitely net you some tasty AM when slotting her in for voyages. 

So, why not tier 1? Well, for starters, we're in a Discovery mega holding pattern, waiting on season three to let us know if they will continue. The Picard mega 8-ball says "Outlook cloudy, try again later". She'll get variants, to be sure, since she's quasi-bridge crew, but it's not exactly safe to treat it as read for her to be snatching up months of bonuses anymore. Her Gauntlet pair looks more impressive than it is, given she'll be curbstomped by an old man with a banjo every time he looks at her, and her collections, while good, are far from exclusive. Just a shade off truly perfect crew. But that's nothing to sniff at, considering the company she keeps. So by all means, cite the former global gift and cross your fingers for further Discovery development.
