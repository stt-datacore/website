We swore that Teska was a sleeping giant and despite picking up only a single faction event and lone collection expansion in the year plus since then, we stand by that assessment. 

Traits are the value driver here and between a CMD base that ranks near the top across all of her traits (including Voyager crew) and seven viable collection possibilities, smart money is on Seska providing excellent long term value.

In the meantime, her voyage efficacy is questionable. Her laundry list of relatively exclusive anti-matter traits meets mediocre raw power and a skill set that’s more populated than you might think. Living in the shadows according to the “Just retrieve Braxton” crowd, Seska is still a viable piece in that area for a while longer, but voyages aren’t the reason you’re buying in on a crew who’s set up nicely to make a lasting impact.
