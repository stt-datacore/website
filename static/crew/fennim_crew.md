"*unintelligible noises*" - Wise words from Fennim. I think he's trying to tell us to rescue him from the Think Tank, but this is one fish you may want to throw back.

An intriguing skill set and favorable distribution of proficiency vs base could really make Fennim a special card if his power level was better. But it's not. So both his gauntlet and voyage potential have a hard cap on them which limits his work there to newer rosters or Seinfeld fanatics.

His hodgepodge of traits doesn't translate to any 45% gauntlets or forecastable event work, but at least make for some intriguing collection potential. An interesting crew from a great episode is let down by the raw numbers for day-to-day value, though he remains a strong speculative add for collection-goers.
