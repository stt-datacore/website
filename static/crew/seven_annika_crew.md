Annika was, at launch, one of just two voyage-capable Seven (of Nine) variants. With time having ravaged her metrics since then, the former MMMBop sensation is on thin ice elsewhere. 

Events are something of a (lumpy) cushion for her, although between lacking in traits and with more than one dud year on her résumé, she's more in the pleasant surprise territory of weekend shuttle names. A 'win with your favorites' level of arena ability is there for fans who want her as a leadoff option on ships, but those without a sentimental attachment are advised to look elsewhere for just about everything Annika offers.
