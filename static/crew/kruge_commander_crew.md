Kruge is pretty sucky, in contrast to his entertaining on-screen role, but there are a few points of interest here. Without a powerhouse Female + Alien rare crew in game to soak up all of the weekend cadet SEC nodes, you may happen upon a few copies of him early and use him to help clear some Sunday missions.

And if you're after (just) his valuable kollection spot, Kruge is a breeze to level by Klingon standards. Most of the faction items needed are basic Warnogs, farmable from ship battles which established players can knock out during the course of a Skirmish event. He’s traitier than a lot of Rare also-rans and a fine name to take a flier on if you’re just looking to flesh out your collections in the midgame.
