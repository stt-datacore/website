Like rings on a tree, BR Bashir marks the 2018 era of power creep; he's hundreds of points better on voyages than older MED options, but hundreds below new ones. Similarly for base, he's no longer the low water mark for event competition thanks to a handful of megas and giveaways since then. His best days behind him, BR Bashir has drifted out of the powerful set and landed in the 'merely' good group with moderate voyage power for a MED primary and a useful base/event pairing.
