Right near the top of Timelines injustices I'd like to correct is the complete lack of usability for this tragic and powerful character portrayed by the late David Ogden Stiers. There's simply nothing here besides a short list of potential collection traits. Look to see that Timicin has hit on at least a couple of them before you consider selecting him in a behold.
