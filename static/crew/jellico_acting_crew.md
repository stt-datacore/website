Regardless of what the scorecard and various metrics say, Jellico is and always will be pure Collection fodder. You don't want him on Voyages no matter how many hundreds of crew may rank lower and you shouldn't feel a pang of regret when that Maverick Mega Event hits and you don't have him. Maybe he would have been an intriguing Arena option without the Trigger and about an eight second faster Initialization, but as it stands, Jellico just won't ... Get it done. 😎
