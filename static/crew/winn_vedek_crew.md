The amount of ear tugging and whimsical phrasings sadly won’t make Winn that good a diplomat. If she’s one of the first DIP crewmembers you acquire then her #15 DIP base will come in useful. But in the long term she will be easily outclassed by most of the other 3* diplomats. She has some use in the weekend missions however but long term, with no extra collection bonuses, she will probably find herself on the wrong side of a vacuum chamber.
