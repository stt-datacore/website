Suspiria is the kind of crew who breaks the fourth wall to illustrate how minute crew evolution can be in this game. The power creep machine will continue to churn out incrementally better base and voyage numbers, but in Suspiria's case she's simply, as Lieutenant Picard would say, bereft of passion and imagination.

Every corner of this card has rounded edges. A zero in the way of gauntlet and arena, she hopelessly attempts to muster voyage efficacy against the stiffest skill set competition in the game and rattles her CMD sabre alongside a trait list that reads far better for the gauntlet than possible event work. (A Nacene gauntlet crew wouldn't make sense anyway...)

Am I still salty about WRGâ€™s lame ass, thoughtless, goose shit skill set for a character that embodies intrigue and exploring the unknown? Pffft nah, man. Naahhh.
