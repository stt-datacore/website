See Sisko, Prophet Sarah. Though we may squeeze the odd event out of his four traits, the bug doesn't really need them to be an elite daily use crew. I normally eschew non-event bases, but in this case you have a voyager you'll never freeze who can handle shuttle duty admirably for two different skills. Double collections are not out of reach for a crew worthy of citations. He's in the mix among the best non-event crew in the game.
