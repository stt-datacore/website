The man of a thousand primaries; Jules' voyage skills are distributed flatter than any crew in the game. His base primary (DIP) remains variant-best and his voyage primary (MED) is the lowest of all MED primary legendary crew. In any case, it hardly matters on voyages anymore as power creep has made a victim of Bashir who ideally should only make runs in very specific situations, if at all.

Bashir's event history, which included a twenty month drought, has clearly been up and down, but with a fistful of usable traits to buoy him throughout, he's not in any danger of slipping into total irrelevance like so many one-offs. Those traits also provide Bashir's greatest point of interest to many players; top flight collection value with room for more.
