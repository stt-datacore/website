Breen Disguise Kira is from the episode where Dukat sits on a giant spike and she has to pull it out of his ass. But just in case you need any more reason to acquire her...

Dipping across franchise lines for a second, Breera at the moment is kind of like that Star Wars Davish Krail meme “Stay on target…stay on target!” Her skill set has been loaded up to a frankly irresponsible degree on voyages, but it’s not quite time to pull the ripcord. Floating around the top ten in overall power grants her temporary plot armor against the power creep monster and some low-competition anti-matter traits like Bajoran and Saboteur should have her catching the eye of voyage calculators for quite a while.

Despite voyages often grabbing this card’s headlines (like, well, right here), she’s quite versatile otherwise. Kira is the very model of a modern major event player, boasting tremendous consistency for variant events along with a few traits that haven’t yet had their day in the sun.

Between new player gauntlet numbers led by a fat SEC roll, an adequate collection profile, and even a little shipboard damage, Kira is the kind of card that we all wish CMD/DIP/SUCK options would be.
