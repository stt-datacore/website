So this is what we’ve come to. Clip show crew. At least Geordi’s Maverick trait may earn him some cachet with the ladies.

Voyages are the name of the game here; a unique skill order among super rares and excellent anti-matter chances make La Forge a juicy acquisition from events for players in the early-to-midgame. He’s serviceable but unexceptional elsewhere with a strong ENG base mopping up the rest of the headlines. La Forge is flush with that skill at the legendary level and it doesn’t appear a ton in faction event seats, but there’s still average or better long term value here once the voyage dust settles.
