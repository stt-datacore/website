Plenty of strong DIP crew in this list but single stats alone doth not make a Vorta. His #6 DIP base and usage on sundayâ€™s cadet missions will keep him active in your roster for a while. But there will become a time when his use has expired and you just want to add a notch to your Diplomat collection. In fairness the gap between the top 3* DIP stats is quite close and if none one better drops for you then Weyoun is a good choice.
