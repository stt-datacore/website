As bland as they come, but with some significant stats. Elite voyage numbers for a super rare, though as CMD/DIP/SEC. When retired from there, highly capable as a DIP base for Faction events thanks to monster event potential. His bland skill set plays in to his ideal use - running Faction shuttles in the most common seats there are. Once Discovery megas dry up (if, indeed, they ever do), his value will plummet, but for now, he's going to be a cornerstone for your weekend shuttles.
