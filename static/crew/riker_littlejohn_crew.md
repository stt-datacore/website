Let's face it - you've gotta be a man to wear tights. Especially with this kind of confidence. But as your mother may have taught you, confidence isn't everything. His voyage numbers are likely going to hit triple digits in a few months, and since he's a complete non-starter when it comes to Gauntlet, Arena or traits (by all means, prove me wrong with a Thief mega), this Littlest of Johns is first and foremost event crew.

But that's no bad thing, especially when he comes with a free spot in a tricky to complete vanity collection - seriously, between pumping stars into this guy or Sheriff Q, I'd hope you know which is the better option - and a SEC base that will, undoubtedly, outperform any other Riker variant. That's about it, honestly; just another CMD/DIP/SEC Riker that you'll find useful, but not that useful.
