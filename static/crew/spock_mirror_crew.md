Spock's not a crew that will make many voyages, especially not now that a once-rare skill set is inundanted with much, much better options. It's best to think of him as a 2-skiller with a huge event count, and indeed, if you want the metrics, including his megas, he's averaged an event bonus every six weeks. That sort of usage can make even bad bases relevant.

An equally unique offering is arena accuracy activating at one second with healthy passive values. He's an excellent compliment to fast activating crew which can save you a lot of time in skirmishes. A Vulcan collection expansion and new Mirror collection have done as much as they can to make this elder Spock card relevant again and worth behold consideration, even if not for daily use.
