Jadzia brings big bases to bear in this incarnation of her character which comes with the requisite strong event pedigree including a sprinkle of traits which have provided another half dozen weekend bonuses. Her other offerings are modest - middling voyage power and slow-but-strong arena evasion - but as a side dish to her evergreen event help, Jadzia is a fine crew to pick up in a behold.
