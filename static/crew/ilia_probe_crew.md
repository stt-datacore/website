It's tough passing on dual 1k bases, but the stars required to tap that potential are usually better spent elsewhere. With her primary as one of the least offered shuttle seats, there are many Faction events where you'll only need one non-bonus option, if any. And for SCI heavy events like those featuring Dax or Burnham, she's likely to be lost in the shuffle of superior options. Android and Romantic traits may briefly pique her value in the future and I would be surprised if she doesn't catch a mega event at some point, but the vast majority of the time her upper limit is a few extra percentage points for daily shuttles. If you want to invest in a SCI option, look for one that offers more flexibility in other areas of the game.
