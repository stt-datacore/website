The best Chameloid in the game, Martia lives and dies by the Traits. Incredibly, they’ve given her a solid Event history with several Mega Event bonuses, and her serviceable Bases have allowed her to chip in on Faction Shuttles during those Event types. A six Collection ceiling makes her a solid choice for Beholds, even if her build cost is Brutal when it comes time to Equip her.
