Let's talk about this particular wolf in the fold. Rather reminiscent of Colonel Q, but what a difference 400% instant damage makes to your long term prospects, eh? A cookie cutter skill set, +1 Diplomat, and base/voyage ranks that just about skirt in the good-to-useable range - very much in the mould of almost everyone that's been released this year, which makes it harder and harder to pick between them, but if your set-up lacks a +Acc and you don't want to go with the meta of Ardra/Scott and co., Jaris is an easily justified quick shot that will find a home with you. Just don't expect him to put in any event work - his best shot is Villain, and unless you start hearing maniacal laughs in the distance, there are better crew to chase.
