DB did a bang up job stocking the shelves with ENG/SEC crew in 2019, but unless you were around to collect them all, Tuvok will be a nice addition to any roster. Among the top voyagers for his skill set and with the only Tuvok-ian ENG base, he's a great example of the type of voyage/event combo platter you want to collect as you piece together coverage of different skill sets and event names. He doesn't offer much fringe utility and the trait set is thinner than it looks at first glance, but he's useful to have in your toolbox and still boasts ample power, and the post-release increase in value for his Vulcan collection will definitely help him stay looking good (bad choice of words?) as he ages.
