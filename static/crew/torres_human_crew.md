I would invite you to flip back and forth between Torres’ crew page and that of Sergey and Helena Rozhenko. Not the most promising first impression, but she does have a couple perks to help her escape obscurity.

There's a huge gulf between her DIP base and the next best Torres option (not you, mom), even at 1/5. Unfortunately, you won't be able to stretch that equity as far as you'd like since this version comes without the Klingon tag, whose bonus pool she’d also do well amongst.

Her handful of viable traits are about as likely as any for future collection and event bonuses, leaving her future value a game of chance set in WRG’s hands. Just don’t expect anything resembling consistent usage, even once fully fused.
