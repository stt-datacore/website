A new entrant into the pointing collection and the game’s first Warp Theorist in years. Now where did I put those party poppers?

Taurik (not to be confused with Vorik, Moerik, or Shemp) doesn’t have any outstanding attributes, which is generally bad news for a card’s debut, but he’s at least a competent voyager with a sprinkling of traits to give him a flexible event and collection cushion once excused from your active roster. If you need a shuttle phasered, Vorik’s your guy. Taurik. Sorry.
