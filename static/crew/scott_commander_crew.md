A pretty lackluster engineer. He sports a significant ENG base with a rather uncommon CMD modifier, but not at the strength that would make him useful for many voyages. The cadet mission zero stings early on, but dual collections and a build light on faction items help him earn a roster spot until you can immortalize.
