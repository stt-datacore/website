What's that old codger got in his hand? Not a bottle of corner shop piss, that's for certain. Irumodic's campaign announcement said it best - "With the Gardener trait, you might have to bring him out of retirement for some shuttle missions." Great sales pitch, WRG.

The shuttle and voyage numbers are still in play for newer rosters despite the card's age. And while his trait value is thinner than many other cards, Picard variant events have provided a good number of thawpertunities thus far.
