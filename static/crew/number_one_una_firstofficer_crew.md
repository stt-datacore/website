What a difference an ENG kicker makes, eh? Serving as a welcome refresh for people who were leaning on Krenim Paris or Admiral Forrest to even out skill totals across a long voyage, Una debuts with a kickass ship ability and a trait set that complements her skills pretty perfectly. This is the kind of crew you can chuck on pretty much any voyage seat, and unlike the glut of CDS crew, she's unlikely to have a direct replacement debuting anytime soon to make you feel bad about investing in her. Her collections profile is a bit more vanilla - not that you can expect much from a show debut promotional card that isn't really keyed to a specific episode - but they're both large collections with a lot of bad crew, and she may well be missing a trait or two due to spoiler-y reasons, so, provided WRG does their due diligence and updates her, expect her stock to only rise.
