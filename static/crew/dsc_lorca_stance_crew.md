This space used to detail Lorca’s top CMD/DIP shuttle pair, which now sits somewhere in the 40s or 50s or 100s I don’t know, I’m just the writer. Most players are only going to utilize this cleaned up Isaacs variant when he has an event bonus, which is predictably far less often than the Disco mega era afforded him. 

Still, with a few eventable and collectable traits in hand, Lorca isn’t really *that* far out of contention when stacked up next to the hundreds of other crew in similar situations. Just keep in mind that long stretches of irrelevance should be expected.
