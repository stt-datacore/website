Disruptor Beam has been kind with voyage friendly crew in 2019, but B-4's somewhat surprising top ten voyage total is, unfortunately, about all that's noticeable about this ponderous cat lover. Some ranked Gauntlet pairs among super rares keep the pudding from spoiling, but considering unimpressive event chances to date (ST:Picard may change that), a mediocre ship ability, no collections, and a truly ridiculous number of Android/Lore variants who are just going to be better, this poor soul is bound to be frozen and forgotten before you can say [_Spot_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiRjywbypLA) as you acquire better, more regularly useful crew. Very useful for early game players, but otherwise forgettable.
