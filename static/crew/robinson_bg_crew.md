A bridge crew photo alongside the rogue Okona encompasses Bronwyn Gail's value past the early game. It's hard to imagine a weaker set of traits for any crew, yet they add at least a dash of flavor to respectable voyage numbers and the Romantic collection seems like only a matter of time.

With a clear path to stasis once replaced on voyages, B.G.'s merely a bone thrown to those Trek/Desperate Housewives crossover holdouts.
