Once considered the worst legendary crew in the game, the Bynars have vaulted up the charts to, like, the fifth-worst. WRG's collection bonanza has given them some level of reprieve and the fact that players can build them lego brick by lego brick from otherwise frozen beholds is certainly a unique value in itself.

Their handsful of viable traits give them a little room for value expansion, but since their only competition for choice is citations and not beholds, you will always have better options for your honor. So I guess that sort of makes this crew note pointless. What are we even doing here? When's lunch?
