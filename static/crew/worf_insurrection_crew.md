Ba’ku Worf, now with kung-fu grip! The value for this particular bazooka-wielding variant is thin, but spans across all types of rosters. New players may find his triggerless arena damage helpful while established rosters should still find his bases worth the thaw for his yearly smattering of Klingon and Worf variant events. Although his collection value is paper thin, it’s attached to a super rare that you may actually use from time to time.
