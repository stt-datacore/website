His stats are nothing special, but his trait-boosted event count is. I'd take lower stats that catch a bonus far more often over a better base rank whose number rarely gets called. A wonky stat blend in the arena may not be a good fit for everyone, but a chunk of instant damage is always worth consideration as is an exclusive vanity collection spot. Hollander is more of a luxury pick with recurrent weekend Faction work to help keep his usability afloat.
