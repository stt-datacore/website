He seems to have lost his communicator somewhere 'round the moons of Nibia, but Kirk still has his phaser locked and loaded. A monster SEC base is up in lights on the marquee and "Starring Captain Kirk" has been the tagline for more events than any other character in the game's history. His voyage work is a bit less mad, considering CMD/SEC's ubiquity, and relies more on the combination of stout overall score and tertiary ENG to make him a viable voyage cog on any roster.

With a couple traits beyond the bare minimum to suppliment Kirk's highs, his brand name and power numbers will make an echoing pressence on your roster.
