One half of the long-awaited 'DBZ in space' fusion crew has arrived in the game. Somewhat mis-labeled as a 'gauntlet crew', Kira is more of an all-rounder, at least at this stage of her lifespan. 

Prophet has the requisite voyage power for a two-to-three year usability profile starting at release on many rosters, but two black marks against her are an awful skill set and the unfortunate timing of being released in the midst of so many other CMD/DIP/SUCK options, most of them superior. There's a chance that when WRG fixes her erroneous Federation and Starfleet traits, they upgrade them with the Duelist and Cultural Figure tags she deserves - hopefully that occurs while she's still a voyage option.

A surprisingly relevant event option for a card with 'gauntlet crew' bases, Kira is the picture of consistency when it comes to event bonuses and has only dipped below four features in a calendar year once. If the aforementioned trait changes are made, that would only enhance her weekend shuttle work which includes perhaps the juiciest skill order possible for shuttle seating.

In order to get paid our three cents per word, we've kept gauntlet for last. Kira does boast worthwhile overall power and a good single roll - good enough to be an option in most of her 25% gauntlets. Unfortunately, her crit is capped at that amount and her skill set is ultra competitive. If you pick her up while you're still Balok-less or to avoid Kahless' price tag, she'll put in more work for you than she would on a "complete" roster, but she's at least an occasional option for everyone.
