As a resource with the hidden historian trait, here's as good a place as any to let players know that Chef Riker debuted in the never-before-seen 13-pack on a Tuesday. Would he still be worth dumpster diving a 13-pack to acquire? No. But don't read too much into that - no crew is worth that!

Falling farther from daily use all the time, you're really looking at the type of event/collection combo that's common among older crew. Two traits put a hard ceiling on his value in both of those areas, but the trait-less Holodeck Enthusiasts collection has at least helped him out in that area and with a reliable Riker event history to fall back on, Chef Riker will remain a mid-low level behold option for years to come.
