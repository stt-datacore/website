One of the less "Mega" mega crew in retrospect, at least by the numbers. His SEC resides in the top ten among Klingon crew, which is his primary event consideration, but may also pick up Hero or Cultural Figure megas down the line. That'll cut it for Faction events and those who have him at 5/5 from his mega will likely tell you he's been manning shuttles for them for a long time. But an unfortunate pairing of poor power and putrid skill set makes him a voyage non-factor.

Though he thoroughly shows his age, Kortar as a package should still have the potential to outperform many older cards. Spotty event work and double collections including the massive Klingon make him a reasonable behold consolation prize.
