She offers no impressive stats for daily use but a DIP base over 900 with bonuses paired with Kira and trait events have her in and out of the freezer. Her equp cost is on the expensive side and littered with faction items, but the weekend work, including three big bonus features, generally pays it off. If you're not a fan of Faction events, a pair of collections including the huge 100 threshold Costume Party offers something to veteran players while her trait lineup has the potential to boost both of those attributes.
