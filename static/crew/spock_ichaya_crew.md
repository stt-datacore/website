All eyes are on SpockBearPig's mouth-watering skill set and thus his voyage work, but it's probably better to think of Spock and Itchy as an event and collection piece who moonlights as a voyager.

With poor debut voyage power that will sink faster than most releases, you'll be counting on that vaunted skill order and accompanying traits to buoy his effectiveness. Due to the scarcity of the CMD/MED pairing, he should find at least minimal work on every roster for the immediate future, but cannot provide broader usability across different voyage combos like a power crew will.

More abiding are a pair of variant-best bases (not easy to do for a man with as many faces as Spock) and a quartet of collections. He may end up performing like a 2-skiller sooner than you'd think, but has all the supplementary tools to overcome poor base and voyage numbers and contribute.
