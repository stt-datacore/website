Did you know that there’s a fan theory that the reason why Starfleet changes their uniforms every five minutes is so that time travelers will know exactly which decade they’re in when they inevitably have to come back and sort out some shenanigans? It’s just about all I could think of as I look at Control Leland, looking almost identical to Covert Operative Leland, wearing the exact same uniform as Agent Harris a hundred years before, and Agent Sloan a hundred years later.

Speaking of CMD/DIP/SUCK, Leland debuted as a strong voyage option and is still worthwhile there, but no longer in the 'later losers' section of the ranks that hold value well. Beware his irritatingly common skill set when looking at an investment starting at star one as his other attributes aren't stellar.

Leland's stats are distributed fairly base-heavy, but with Disco dead he hasn't had too many chances to utilize those stats on shuttles. With a collection ceiling that Balok could bump his head on, Leland is a fine voyage piece, but lacking in utility or apparent long term value.
