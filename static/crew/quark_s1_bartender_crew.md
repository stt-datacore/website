If it wasn’t for his usefulness in the Ferengi collection I would say just airlock this guy straight away. He just about stays out of the lowest tier due to that and some useful traits that can unlock some early mission nodes. He has the lowest Diplomacy primary stat for any crew as well as having the lowest command AND lowest security bases for all the crew in the game. Don’t feel bad about pushing him out of the airlock, his only use is to tick a box and serve a drink.
