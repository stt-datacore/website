Flappy Bird (please don't sue) was a pretty strong daily use candidate when he launched as an event reward in 2019. This is what daily use super rares tend to look like after a few years.

While still an edge case for voyages if a new player manages to acquire several stars at once (note that he has multiple features), the most likely trajectory for for Aleek-Om is relevancy solely reliant on a single trait; Innovator. It will power almost all of his event and collection value moving forward barring unpredictable event features or a sweeping trait audit.
