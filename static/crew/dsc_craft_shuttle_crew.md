In the minisode that Craft hails from, Zora, the Discovery's computer gone all Blade Runner because it's been left parked in a nebula for a thousand years (don't ask), found him interesting enough to fall in love. If only this version of him were half as fascinating. If only he felt more...hand-crafted.

Craft's bad voyage skill set meets power running on empty to knock him out of consideration there and with arena as his only standout daily usefulness, we instead turn to traits. 

Already a name with multiple collections, Craft has a respectable ceiling in that area, but his traits haven't done much to give his bases weekend work in the wake of Discovery megas. With those shuttle opportunities being entirely unpredictable, consider Craft primarily a collection piece whose skill set will earn him spot work when he's lucky and catches an event bonus.
