Professor Sato's much heralded arrival and domination of the DIP scene put a big dent in the vast majority of Loque'eque's appeal. Sato's events aren't frequent enough to carry any cards to value on their own and Loque'eque's DIP is not quite high enough to be special. She'll still perform fine for that once a year event, but is little more than a part-time daily shuttle pilot.
