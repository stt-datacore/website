Another day, another DIP crew you don't need. It's no longer stunning to see 1200+ bases, especially for the diplomacy skill, which you'll probably notice is becoming big enough to shove several entire MED crew rosters inside. Fun, huh? A day late and a dollar short for events too (Pilot), Yates' best (only?) chance for future weekend impact would seem to be wielding a top five DIP base for a theoretical costumed mega - and that's a lot of maybes.

In addition to a cookie cutter skill set and few useful traits, she lacks any pop or notable attributes, save for a chunk of shipboard crit which is usable, but replaceable. If you're okay with "stats good enough for daily use" crew, chase the ones with interesting skill sets and save your CMD/DIP/SEC hunting for the truly special cards.
