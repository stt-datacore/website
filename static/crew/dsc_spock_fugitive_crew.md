A prior campaign freebie, Fugitive Spock shouldn't be underestimated. Leading the field for event bonuses by a huge margin and doing so with a fat SCIence base means he's probably bleeding you dry of merits if you've dared to freeze him. Which shouldn't be until the late game as his SCI/SEC skill pair is hurting for legendary representation on voyages, both in number and in power. He may not boast any unique or must-have offering, but is among the most stout base/voyage/event triads in the game at any rarity.
