The man of a thousand primaries; Jules' voyage skills are distributed flatter than any crew in the game. His base primary (DIP) is variant-best and his voyage primary (MED) is the lowest of all MED primary crew. In any case, both attributes are reliant on opportunity - the voyage work depending on how much MED you have available to you.

Bashir's event history, which included a 20 month drought, has clearly been up and down, but after getting back on track in 2019, and with a fistful of traits beside, he's not in any danger of slipping into total irrelevance like so many one-offs. Triple collections are punctuated by his vanity, which is likely to be the only one relevant when finishing this mid-range legendary.
