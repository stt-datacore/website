Straight out of one of Season 2 of Star Trek: Picard’s seminal scenes, Devious Duet Jurati belts out a ballad as she swings her way into Star Trek Timelines!  An oft-requested crew from this season, this is the version of Jurati who hasn’t yet transformed into the Borg Queen seen in both the first and final episodes of the season, but she’s well on her way, and she’s got the Borg trait to prove it!

Thank goodness that WRG remembered to include Jurati’s Physician trait on launch this time and nobody had to raise a pitchfork or torch to get it included like her debut Super Rare version from Season 1 of Picard a couple years back.  Traits are certainly one of DDJ’s strengths, stepping into the game with four collections and 3 more “viable traits” (if you include Desperate).  Notedly, “Resistance is Futile” is a tough collection with few recent inclusions, meaning in order to complete it you need to finish a lot of decrepit Legendaries.  I’m looking at you, OG Seven of Nine!

As we keep “following the traits” (copyright Automaton_2000, 2022) we find that they allow this proto-Borg Queen to hop on to no less than EIGHT antimatter seats, which means we can safely say that she is a far superior to recent skillset peer King Ridley, who can only parlay his voyage power onto five.  She echoes the voyage utility of aging but still elegant Indulgent Seven, who also had eight antimatter seats.  Do you remember how long Cheesecake Seven managed to voyage for you?  Well, you can anticipate this new crew in a similar niche even after her voyage power wanes via the inevitable and accelerating WRG Power Creep:™:!
Jurati is not likely to get a lot of variant events as #1: her show is ending and #2: she’s written off of it, but her decently girthy DIP base and myriad of traits may allow her to catch some weekend duty.  She won’t do much in gauntlet, even with the few middling rolls she has, but her ship ability requires a moment’s inspection.  A 2 limit use 400% instant damage ability at 12s means that if you SOMEHOW don’t have any of the 6s options she can help you out until you retrieve yourself a Killy or Killy-clone.

Try to resist wanting this crew, but it may be futile!
