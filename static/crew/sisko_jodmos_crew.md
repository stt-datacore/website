He's no dung beetle, in fact Klingon Sisko is pretty far from shit. Providing stock standard shuttle and voyage help in the early game, Jodmos blooms again post-cryo, especially in the eyes of veteran players.

His current collection cornucopia is enough justification for automatic behold status on endgame rosters, while his traits provide room for growth in that area and also supplement Sisko’s main cast status on the weekend, pushing him into top shelf event crew status. Don’t be put off by the unremarkable skill set, this is a prime crew for players of any level to target.
