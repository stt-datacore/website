“G. I. Chuck is Voyager's top secret one man strike force team. The mission: to defend the Vori. The threat: the Kradin, a hostile species bent on extermination. The battle cry: Yo Chuck!"

A Legendary Crew to be glimpsed in Voyage rewards? Fathom it to be true, for I am no Krady beast. That’s right, we finally have our first ever 5* reward added to the Voyage loot tables! Rambotay here can be found as a Dilemma reward starting at the 6hr mark, so may the odds be ever in your favour.

Should your Voyage reward you with this Voyager Crew, your future Voyages will be better off for it. Chakotay may be yet another CDS, but he’s a top SEC/DIP pairing available to all players capable of reaching a 6hr Dilemma and has oodles of AM Seat traits at his disposal (many of which are prime for Collections down the line). To top it off, with 400% Instant Damage at 8s and a meaty SEC Proficiency to go with a couple of 45% Crit Chances, he’s a dark horse choice in Arena and Gauntlet. Elderly players may yawn at this but he will be a great find for younger and middle-aged accounts.

Unless of course this is all just an illusion…
