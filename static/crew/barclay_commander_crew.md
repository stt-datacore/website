CMD/ENG may be a little less barren than it was, thanks largely to Ru’afo and a few recent event purples, but it’s always nice to stack up on uncommon skill sets. For early players, Broccoli is likely to be very helpful, but more seasoned rosters will find he’s better in the freezer, adding +1 Holodeck Enthusiasts and +1 Innovator, and will only find themselves thawing him out for the odd Barclay event.
