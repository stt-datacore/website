Boothby has been on the receiving end of more excuses why not to cite him than any card in the game. He didn’t have collections…he’s not main cast… Despite holdouts missing out on several wonderful years of his voyage potential, Boothby still has plenty more in the tank.

Superb overall power and a reasonable anti-matter rate keeps Boothby continually viable as a voyager even if most voyage calculators don’t give him his due thanks to a proficiency-heavy spread. But those little numbers in the parenthesis also make him a reliable gauntlet option. DIP/SCI competition from Locutus and a crit ceiling capped at 25% are notable drawbacks, but Boothby’s mammoth overall proficiency gives him some play in several different skill pairs.

With a few collections being added to his value profile, the best time to cite your Boothby was 2018, but the second best time is today.
