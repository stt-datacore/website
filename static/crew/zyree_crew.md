You're a new crew. A 2-dimensional being laid flat on the drawing board in WRG's offices.

"Should we make her usable in Gauntlet?" 

"Should we give her anything other than the worst Voyage skill set in the game, or many useful Traits?" 

All you hear is uproarious laughter and the sound of a cocktail shaker. 

This is your life as a Dosi. As arguably one of the top two Dosi in the game, Zyree possesses a tissue paper-thin Trait set which will top out at two possible Collections and Voyage power that only her mother could love.  If you want a keepsake from that amusing little DS9 episode, fix yourself a Gamma Quadrant Mimosa with some Tullaberry juice, kick back, and enjoy the show.
