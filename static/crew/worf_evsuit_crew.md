A mouth-watering skill set, especially for a Klingon/Worf, probably put a few more dollars in WRG’s pocket upon EV Suit’s release. As he ages out of voyage work, however, and struggles to find “and MED” seats in Klingon events, how much value does that unique skill set confer?

Never a particularly traity character, Worf does at least have WRG’s favor in terms of event count with an easy-to-seat SEC primary to match. Spot on art and with a dash of trait-matching voyage runs left in him, Worf is closer to Temporal Prisoner Chakotay than Tuesday pack must-have, yet is a viable behold choice much of the time.
