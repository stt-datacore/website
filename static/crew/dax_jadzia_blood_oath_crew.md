Her art makeover from melted crayon to hatchet man was the most exciting thing this Jadzia had done in ages, but her arguably generous inclusion in the Klingon kollection gave her value a spark. While voyage power, base oomph, gauntlet, and arena are all missing in action, she's at least worth snagging for mid-game event work and a Stellar collection spot.

Formerly exploitable niches of voyage skill set and lack of Dax SEC are both hamstrung by an abysmal relative power. With a handful of untapped collection traits lined up, Dax has *probably* hit rock bottom already and should climb back toward collection piece over time.
