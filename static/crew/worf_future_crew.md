Stock standard on voyages, he retains residence in the top 100 ranks despite his age to help offset a skill combo that you already have too much of. And though there are several names whose résumé reads similarly when you're looking for help with the expansive Klingon collection, there's a bit more meat on the bone here.

Guv's big CMD score is more than suitable for daily shuttles and though he doesn't have many eventable traits to prop up his bonus count, Worf + Klingon is far better than most crew get, while that CMD score is over three hundreds points better than Worf's next best option. His only other peripheral perk is a hardy +11 arena attack that comes online quickly enough if you can meet the trigger requirement and helps round out a crew who's about as valuable as it gets for his skill set.
