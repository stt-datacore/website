The ultimate 'sum of her parts' crew had one of those parts upgraded with the advent of the Costume Party collection. Not only are players essentially required to take her in beholds to stack up skill boosts in the late game, but they may not even be able to freeze her either. Staving off competition from legendary crew, Ardra is one of the premier Arena and Skirmish talents in the game.

Serviceable accuracy on a short fuse meets a massive chunk of crit bonus that will nearly triple the damage outputs of your crits, further boosted by her excellent offensive shipboard passives. The accessibility of that offering being hosted by a super rare crew shouldn't be understated and even makes her one of the few viable super rare targets from Crew Retrieval. Her non-standard trait set makes that a realistic possibility and even leaves the door open for further collection or event bonus chances down the line.
