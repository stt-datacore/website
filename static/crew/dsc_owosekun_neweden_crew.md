NEO is a crew without holes. If we accept that only a very few crew hold esteemed spots in the gauntlet and shuttle rankings, then we're glad to welcome aboard the new #1 Discovery super rare SEC without reservation. The Disco mega freight train is still chugging along and Owo will be manning shuttles there several times a year if you can spare her from voyage duty. SEC/SCI doesn't have strong representation among legendary crew and so her satisfactory power there meets a useful skill set for some pre-freezer work on early to mid-game rosters. Her arena numbers speak of Ardra-lite usability for new players and a spot in a stat-boosting collection is the cherry on top.
