‘Hey, Lt. Commander Spock, can I borrow your homework?’ ‘Sure, just salute with your other hand so they don’t notice.’

Originality aside, this is indeed a crew worth noticing. Similar to Spocko in many ways, Burnham exchanges arena torpedoes for traits (Innovator, really?) to help differentiate herself statistically. So while ships and coin flips are out the window, Burnham will run hot in just about every other part of the game.

Big girl voyage power is hardly unheard of in 2022 as she’s the fifth crew to top the charts in the last year (weep for our outdated crew notes), but for that attribute alone she should have at least secured a spot in your retrieval queue once she hits the portal. With her handful of traits supplementing endless Burnham events and a big CMD base to use in them, Burnham will be busy on your roster for years to come.
