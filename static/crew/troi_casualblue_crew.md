With a high MED base and a good range of DIP/CMD to fall back on the Empathetic Empress here is one of the best rare cards to have. She has a few useful traits to knock out nodes and can work on all the weekend cadets. Seeing how rare MED skills are later in the game I wouldn't be surprised if she stays in your active roster once the weekend cadet missions are finished. Just make sure you have a lot of Holoprograms and Medical Experiments stocked up as she needs a lot of them to fully equip.
