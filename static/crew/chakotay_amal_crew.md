His employment file lists his given name; Daily Use. Amal Kotay might only make the thaw list once a year for veteran players, but sterling base and voyage ranks mean all the work he can handle into the mid-game.

Between the general dearth of ENG crew early on and no super rare sharing his skill set across the top fifty voyagers, it's a happy marriage of skills and power for Chakotay. Once excused from that area, his top super rare ENG base will either be a great option for daily shuttle runs or free up other ENG crew to voyage instead.

Despite lacking elite peripherals, Chakotay will function like a partially fused legendary crew in crucial voyage and shuttle situations as your roster graduates toward an all-gold lineup.
