In keeping with Brent Spiner's fantastic comedic relief in The Big Goodbye, WRG did us all a solid and made the hilarious choice of giving Carlos Data a beefy MED secondary. Presumably triage classes were held some time between plugging in lamps and bending guns.

But as long as such injustices don't result in another boring, retread skill set, we'll take it. And even though SCI/MED/ENG is now strangely on the common side for golds, Data wears it well, making names like Amanda Rogers or Loken look like a facsimile. A knock off. A cheap imitation.

Rather than matching voyage strength with shuttle strength, Carlos opts to fill a few different holes in Data's skill portfolio. Blowing past all other variant SCI options and offering the only MED for his character, he'll have no trouble finding work during his events and in some cases may be one of very few bonus options with his skills.

Timely arena accuracy, a handful of collections, sturdy voyage credentials, and a much-needed refresh of Data variant power all serve to make him a no-brainer acquisition the next time you're in South America.
