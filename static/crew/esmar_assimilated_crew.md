I know we give this joke a lot of mileage but… please welcome the best Haliian in the game… Assimilated Esmar! Ok, so I bet you didn’t think one of the first handful of Picard S3 crew would be Esmar, but here they are, all super Borgy and ready to party! What’s notable is that they represent the 41st Borg Crew in game, so it’s no longer required to purchase BOTH Nanoprobe Phlox AND Borg Queen Seven from the Honor Hall… to finish that Collection, so yay?

All jokes aside, Esmar has “aggressively average” Voyager power for 2022 or 2023 Legendary, so you gotta look elsewhere for value. Traits, baby! Aforementioned Borg Trait has a few friends in its collective, notedly one more for now, and up to two more viable ones to add value later. CMD/SEC/ENG (in any permutation) has long been ruled by Braxton, and now you’ve got Chances Taken Kirk from the Captain’s Bridge ruling the roost, along with the former Webstore Exclusive we are still unwilling to mention and Wanted Mariner. But, if you’re missing a lot of those better, Esmar should pitch on on your Voyages and has six Antimatter seats to plop down in and get comfy.

If you’re pretty new and can snag a copy, they also have a 400% Instant Damage Ship Ability, with a Limit of two uses, so they can anchor a Skirmish or Arena team until you retrieve better crew to replace them.
