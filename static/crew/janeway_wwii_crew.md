Janeway is not an event name you need to worry about, even if she's had her ups and downs, but that's about all you're getting from the former Section 31 recruit. Her voyage power is missing in action and her traits' pools would seem to be either too large or too small to support much weekend work out of left field. A #2 variant SEC base just ahead of former mega Determined Janeway is just about all she can hang her hat on for contributions to your roster.
