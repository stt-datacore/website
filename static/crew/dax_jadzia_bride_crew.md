You don't often see legendary crew with a base ranked in the triple digits, but where that might signal the gauntlet horn, Dax is more like the gauntlet kazoo. Built like a (very) budget Bartender Guinan, Bride hangs her hat on a serviceable DIP roll and a pair of 45% gauntlets to make her a sometimes-include for players in the early-to-midgame. And while bad bases and iffy proficiencies mean she's no longer a voyager, the profile perks up from there.

Dax is still a bankable event name, even if she won't repeat that Stellar 2017, and has hit on five of her traits to provide further weekend bonuses. As a 4th shuttler or requisition piece, she'll collect bonuses often enough to make the investment worthwhile, in this area at least. Tacking on a few collection spots years after her release with more waiting in the wings has helped to supplement the value of a card whose surface level ranks clearly show her age.
