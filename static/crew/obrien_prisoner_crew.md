Two great areas of daily use for new players, arena and gauntlet, are just a few power notches shy of being enticing, but are still worth noting for brand new rosters. Despite a low overall proficiency, ENG rolls can be very hard to acquire for early gauntlet play. O'Brien's good single roll and trio of 45% gauntlets make for a reasonable stepping stone at one star.

A trait-laden event history for this variant is about all we can ask for and one hopes it continues, though an ENG primary often hurts for shuttle seating in any given event and he won't always be worth the thaw. Those same traits have given him reasonable overall collection value and makes him worth targeting for that reason alone once you've switched to legendary crew for all your daily use needs and look to start stacking collection skill boosts.
