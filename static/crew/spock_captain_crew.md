Captain Spock would remind us that "Klingons don't have tear ducts", but forum posters do. Stats for the iconic movie Spock came in a hair under impressive and heralded the opening of many new salt mines, but years later he still has some value.

Go figure, his stats haven't gotten better over time, but a seriously impressive event résumé that's not reliant on just his variant bonuses or a big trait like Disco means that he's one of the safest bets to collect fistfuls of bonuses going forward. 

Unlikely to puncture the top ranks of gauntlet spreadsheets, Spocko at least has a reasonable CMD proficiency and over a dozen elevated crit sets for fresh rosters to break into that competitive area of the game. And, of course, collections. Some immediate and potential value here pairs well with a crew who will be riding event shuttles for years to come and helps justify the trip to five stars.
