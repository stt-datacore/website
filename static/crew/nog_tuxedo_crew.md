Noggles won the race; first to five collections. No takebacks! While others may pass him in the future, he'll still remain one of the best values in that area of the game and especially alluring to large aquatic mammals who have run out of "tier 1" crew to cite and are looking to min/max collections.

The drop-off from there looks somewhat severe, but there's still value to be had. New players will have the chance to enjoy a bit of gauntlet maneuverability thanks to a handful of 45%+ crit sets while event work has several reasonable paths to appearance via all of those collection traits and a light dusting of Nog every now and then.
