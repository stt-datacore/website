Fairly forgettable for a Mega Event Recurring Legendary, Etana won't reclaim daily use status going forward, but a pot of percolating Traits have been simmering for a while and may be soon ready to serve.

The first crack in that dam was the addition of a 65% Gauntlet post-release. That may be the only unique Gauntlet where established rosters bring her along, but considering the absolute dearth of ENG options among non-Exclusive crew, she makes for fine one-star help to newer rosters.

Her non-Ktarian traits have been thrown out there in the past as viable Collection or event Traits and it wouldn't be a surprise to see any or all of them hit in the future. Until they do, and considering her twilight power elsewhere, approach with caution.
