Seeing this peppy two skiller appear on your Behold screen isn’t going to be much fun(gus), but it could be worse - you could have invested in her mid-2019 six pack, then quickly watched her SEC base fall out of the top ten, go into free fall, and smack down in the high twenties. All while Disco megas dried up and you realised one of her two traits, Survivalist, had already had its mega two months before she debuted. Oops.

To soften the blow, a collection has mushroomed around her - yes, she does count as Mirror (#2 SEC/#5 SCI base), that’s not a mistake on her trait readout - but we really can’t recommend you take her at 1/5 unless the other options are truly diabolical.
