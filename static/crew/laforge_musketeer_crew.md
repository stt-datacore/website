Like most LaForges, Musketeer is a well-rounded crew with fingers in many of Wesley's pies. A pair of usable bases pop up on Faction lists often enough between Geordi-flavored weekends and his handful of traits which show more promise than most. D'Artagnan's voyage and gauntlet profiles are fairly similar - mid-level power, but with a plus skill set. That being said, if you've been doing your due diligence and collecting some of the more recent SEC/ENG names that have cropped up in events or packs, you might be scrolling longer and longer to find him on that voyage selection screen.

In the casino, a Caretaker-sniping SEC/ENG pair hits 45% crit from time to time to make him a worthwhile include, even on established rosters. Add in dual collections and a six second arena ability to give him possibilites for work in just about every phase of the game, even The Next Phase.
