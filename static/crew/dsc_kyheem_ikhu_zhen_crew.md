So, you’ve found yourself in the middle of a Faction event, battling out with the wallets of whales.  The prize for your efforts? A new, shiny Legendary MED character with a top 100 Voyage rank on debut.  So he’s a lock for instant cite, right?  Well.....

Unlike his Ikhu Zhen brother Booker, Kyheem doesn’t quite check all the boxes for a ‘must have’ version.  Sure, he’s got a good Voyage rank upon debut and MED primary Voyagers are always in demand.  Sadly, Khyeem only brings two trait matches to his bonus power, bringing him in-line or behind Vedala Elder and Devious Duet Jurati, both whom are stronger in almost all metrics.  Plus, if your Fleet has helped you past the halfway point of Fleet Boss Battles, you’ve then earned a stronger mix of the same ingredients in Frantic McCoy.

Finding some positives to talk about, as the #3 MED base, a fully-fused copy will make daily shuttles for you.  Kyheem also starts off with 3 Collections, and bringing 4 more potentials to the table.
As time rolls on, you’ll come back to this note and find that Khyeem didn’t age well, and his Voyage power has dropped quite a bit.
