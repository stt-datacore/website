A reasonable attempt though it may have been, no card can really do justice to Scotty's heroics on [stardate unknown], where without his impeccable power balancing and, presumably, cross-circuiting to B, we may not have had a happy ending to the episode which launched a host of hokey and cherished Mirror Trek episodes.

Mirror Monty isn’t here to make a deal, in fact most of his attributes can be found in the bargain bin. He debuted as the best pound-for-pound Scotty in the game, but compared to modern Timelines, he’s about four traits and two scoops of power short. With most of his offerings - voyage, shuttles, collections - south of noteworthy, it won’t be a shock if you end up utilizing them for a time, but certainly not for long before relegating him to the vault.
