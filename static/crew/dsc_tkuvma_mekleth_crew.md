The former Mega crew has tormented arena-goers for over a year, but as Skirmishes and certain new crew have pushed players toward faster burst damage, T'kuvma has gone from terror to liability in some circumstances. His 375% chunk of damage at 10 seconds is certainly great for new players and can help shorten Skirmish battles. But with crew like Killy entering the portal (and given as a previous DB blunder apology) alongside RP Kirk and other 6-8 second burst crew, T'kuvma may end up as an expensive paperweight in the arena.
This guide judges crew at 5/5 (or 4/4), but something to think about if you're eyeing T'kuvma in a behold; you will need a supplementary +Attack crew while he sits at lower star counts - something that those who acquired him in the mega rarely had to face. Outside of ship battles, he's most likely to find work in trait events, including the possibility to splash in yet another all-Disco mega, or as a gauntlet fifth when his traits align.
