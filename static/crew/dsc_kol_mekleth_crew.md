Discovery Klingons are much the same. Printed years ago, they lack the power to compete in modern Timelines, but have a handful of collections and two handfuls of events for sporadic periods of relevance. Considering Kol was a disappointment even at the time of his release as a mega recurring crew, you can safely eschew him in all beholds except those in which collections are your only consideration. Heâ€™s merely a stocking stuffer to tide you over until that silver Lexus with a giant red ribbon rolls up your driveway. Who the fuck buys those as a gift?
