Tuvok's wings have been clipped compared to his soaring heights on release. Voyages are beyond his capabilities if you have comparable skill set/fuse level options and his powerful attack boost on ships is slow enough that you can generally find (or retrieve) better options.

But there's good value in a multi-collection piece who also enjoys an event m√®lange of Tuvok, Vulcan, and Borg events while sporting the right shuttle skills to boot. There are reasons for almost every roster to snag stars on Tuvok in a behold, even if he does more of his heavy lifting post-cryo these days.
