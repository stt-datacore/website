Following a veritable deluge of top shelf crew with the likes of Dexa, Human Saru, Reunion Spock & Kirk, Captain Tribble... Adira might seem like a step down, but the truth is they're simply a quality, no-frills crew who shouldn't have to live up to the lofty ambitions of their gold predecessors.

Xahean breaks with the DIP/ENG-y feel of previous gold variants to contribute the all too populous CMD/DIP/SCI set on voyages. Competition exists there from all angles, including a handful of former megas, campaigns, global giveaways, and the aforementioned powerhouse crew like RSK and Human Saru. While Adira's voyage power is adequate, being tethered to that bloated skill set ensures that they remain merely that; an adequate voyager.

Event futures for Discovery crew remain murky following the apparent end to blanket bonuses for that particular show, but the Adira character has practically kicked the doors in to signal their arrival with three quality gold variants in short order, two of them coming from event features. With an important tie to the best non-gauntlet collection in the game, Xahean is a worthwhile, if unexciting pick-up from one of the most loaded, crew-quality megas in the game's history.
