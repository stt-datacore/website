If you're in the market for a voyage-only crew with a bad skill set, you've come to the right place. There's some very thin value on the periphery in the form of untapped traits and a 65% gauntlet, but if you're looking into Osyrra, it's generally because she debuted with competent voyage power or because you have a star floating around on your roster and forgot where it came from.

She owns a few metrics that don't look terrible, but like a true Orion woman, it's an illusion. Barring an improvement to the relevancy of her traits, try to avoid adding stars except against truly awful behold choices.
