With deficient power in most areas of play, Rakal at least makes for a passable starter crew, assuming the cost to Equip can be met. Skill set potential for Voyages and Gauntlet will fade fast as your roster grows, but MED/CMD is a hard combo to stack and will lessen the competition she faces in the Gauntlet where you would only bring her along with elevated Crit.

Troi's Event tally is pretty immaterial with such putrid Bases in tow. If you've gotten to the point of freezing this crew, you probably have better options to handle such duty, even those without a bonus. Lastly, while her Collection future is unknown, having enough non-HFS Traits to start a family band is a good launching pad and at least leaves the door open on the possibility of value expansion in that area. One can picture Rakal with up to three likely Collections when all is said and done.
