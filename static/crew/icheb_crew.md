Itchy's Events stop and start more than a rusted, red '36 Ford as he lives from Trait bonus to Trait bonus, but they have done a good job providing him chances at some Shuttle piloting along with a trio of Collections. In the early game, Icheb can provide a stopgap option on your Ships with a 350% Instant Damage ability behind a Position Trigger.
