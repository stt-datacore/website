I just want to say - still salty about removing her Bajoran trait days before its first event bonus. Dick move, man.

Traits are indeed the name of the game for Seska who, despite an ENG-led skill set, has zero functionality for normal day to day operations. With Kazon and Obsidian Order traits not likely to bear fruit for collections or events, sheâ€™s more or less hanging on to three traits for value, but has a valid chance to hit her collection ceiling before too long.
