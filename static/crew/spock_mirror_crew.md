Considering his pathetic voyage and gauntlet profiles, it's best to think of Mirror Spock as a 2-skiller with a huge event count - he's averaged an event bonus about once every month and a half for the duration of Timelines. That sort of usage can make even bad bases relevant.

An equally unique offering is arena accuracy activating at one second with healthy passive values. He's an excellent compliment to fast activating crew which can save you a lot of time in skirmishes. In concert with those unique attributes, Spocko's fistful of collections and interesting traits have done about as much as they can to keep this elderly Spock card relevant and worth behold consideration, even if not for daily use.
