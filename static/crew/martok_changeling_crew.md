No one is particularly excited to see Changeling Martok, which is totally understandable, but he does have a few edge not yet smoothed, thanks to a top five gauntlet pair that's competitive against everyone not named Locutus or Gowron and dual collections. On the weekend he's amassed a formidable number of bonuses which should at least merit behold consideration against the plethora of one-hit wonders floating around. Average in most areas, Martok's prospects are as attractive as the character himself, but is still better value than loads of other non-starters.
