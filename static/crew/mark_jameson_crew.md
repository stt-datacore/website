The WinnebagoChair Deluxe with custom wood paneling has a tailpipe about this long...this thick. And it makes Jameson one hell of a voyager.

If not for mega recurring Lt. Sahil or 6-packer Fencing Picard released mere minutes before ol' Mark here, Jameson would have been quite the prize. He still debuts as an elite voyager with a little collection value and is more than fans of Michael Pataki-adjacent characters could have hoped for.

No events to his name as of his release meant that ground floor buyers knew what they were getting themselves into. As long as Mr. Button is still a top 50ish voyager by the time you come to him, he'll be a reasonable investment for TNG sentimentalists - just beware the sharp fall off in value once he ages himself out of the big chair.
