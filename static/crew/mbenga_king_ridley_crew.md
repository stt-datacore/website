The King of Kings, Ridley debuts with the kind of power and versatility that main cast medical personnel aspire to (seriously, if you want to feel bad, go have a look at the wide array of decrepit 5* Bashirs). Apart from Gauntlet, he hits on almost every area of the game in some way, ranging from the obvious like his trio of collections and potential for two more to voyage power in the 'pretty damn good' range - experienced rosters might be looking to phase him out after a good 2-3 years of use, but it's a well known fact that MED voyagers tend to work long past retirement just because of the rarity of the skill set. If you want to see some metrics that put what feels like 85% of current crew releases to shame, just have a glance down at his outperformers tab; also-rans like DeSoto, FOB or Chef Pike wish they could corner the market so exclusively.

Digging a little deeper, the community has been advocating for the Elysian Kingdom to get its own Badda Bing-esque collection for some time now, and while M'Benga may have been the obvious choice to be the Scapegoat O'Brien equivalent, WRG has seemingly eschewed that in favour of giving everyone a shot at him. That being said, there are still a few major players who have yet to debut from that episode, so who knows who he could be a gateway toward? Combined with an out-of-the-box Fleet Boss Battle ready 25% hull repair for all your Artifact sustaining needs and sumptuous art, Ridley is almost a complete package.

Almost.

M'Benga's biggest Achilles heel is the simple fact that outside of MED centric events, there simply isn't a ton of MED seats that need staffing with non-bonus crew. The simple fact is that while he may have a hefty primary base, you may not get much of a chance to use it outside of your daily shuttles, especially since SNW events are still up in the air and M'Benga's had precisely one event - this calendar year. That being said, the two bases ahead of him are a one skiller and a two skiller, in that order, so if you want someone to fill that ONE MED seat you get in a sea of CMD/DIP/SEC and you don't already have the Titan of Southern Medicine or Golden Boy Culber, M'Benga can fulfil that role well enough while also doing, you know. Other things, too. Other things can be nice, so I'm told.
