He no longer owns a sterling #1 gauntlet pair, but thanks to his availability as a mega event crew, the Walls of Surak (my band's name) still echo in the gauntlet. Besides being unavoidable there, a healthy SCI base and even better voyage total have him contributing from multiple angles. With Vulcan unlikely to be his last trait mega, it would be only logical to behold him if you have the chance.

He's one of the best daily use crew in the game and excellent right from star one, with the addition of extra tiers to the Vulcan collection making him arguably even more useful than when he first debuted. With names like Picard and Number One now on everyone's rosters, seemingly crowding him out in certain areas, you might think twice about him, but trust in logic, and let Vulcan Jesus help you find what you're looking for.
