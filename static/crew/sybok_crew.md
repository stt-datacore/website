His badass villain name isn't even the best thing about this guy. No longer a worthy voyage piece, he still sports an 800+ DIP base, double collections, intriguing traits for events, and usable arena EV as the cherry on top. His biggest drawbacks are not having variant events and an expensive build consisting of the typical Vulcan faction items and nearly twenty 4* components. He may not get you to Sha-Ka-Ree, but heâ€™ll help you pass the Great Collection Barrier
