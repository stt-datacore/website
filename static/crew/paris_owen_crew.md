The most useful of the DS9 era uniformed Admirals, Paris is on the edge of helpful for voyages, provided you can obtain the requisite number of stars, but should find most of his work in the gauntlet. Twenty total elevated crit gauntlets should be plenty for newer players using Paris as a stepping stone to gold level CMD/SEC options.

One of his three collectionable traits have triggered, giving him some long term value, though his room for growth in that area is limited. See you in Sto-vo-kor, L'Kor.
