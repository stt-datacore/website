Sistine Chapel she is not, but Christine is still worth snagging. Disappointing release numbers are softened by a MED-led skill set for voyages and two scoops of collections automatically lift her value above many other names. Chapel's base ranking is inflated in a depressed MED skill, but with a smattering of trait potential and the juicy prospect of a second date with Leonardo in a re-run, she may pitch in post-cryo from time to time.
