The only 4* variant of Guinan and, unfortunately, the least impressive of them all. If you earn her first copy from achievements, it's perhaps best to leave her unclaimed for a little while until you net another copy on voyages. Saddled with a common DIP/SEC skillset and 2 events (Guinan + Brutal), this imp will contribute little in the long run outside of a #47 DIP base, and an only halfway competitive Gauntlet pair that will occasionally hit 45% crit - and even then, usually amongst walls of her much bigger sisters. Freeze and forget, if you're lucky enough to get enough copies to fuse her up.
