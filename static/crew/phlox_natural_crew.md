Even if you don't have fond mammaries of Phlox, you have to admit his body of work has been impressive. The cupboard is no longer bare of ENG/MED crew and we can be more pec and choosy about who we thrust out there, butt he's still a member of a most attractive skill set even though his power has sagged tremendously.

And while his SCI base no longer warrants a wolf whistle, it's still a thicc and formidable package when taken alongside his fringe benefits, such as his dangling gauntlet pairs. What perks up his desirability the most is a big ol' rack of collections which offers value that's far from titular. 

P.S. Can anyone figure out why he has the casual trait? He's on duty in sickbay...
