Burnham and Picard sometimes get flak for "leaning slightly left" variant art, but you can't tell me that Evil and Android Kirks aren't the same guy at different points in the Macarena.

Regardless of a boring appearance, Kirk does boast a few notables. He dethrones Desert T'Pol for the top SEC/SCI voyage pair and comes in quite high in the overall rankings. And Kirk's elite, well-documented event history meets a few off-brand traits to hopefully spike month-long weekend appearances. Like his namesake, not the most inspirational card on your roster, but certainly not without uses.
