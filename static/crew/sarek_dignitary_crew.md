If you were ever curious what petty squabbling with your son, antagonizing your wife, and frustrating Tellarites gets you in the long run, the answer is simple - a big Diplomacy base! For some variants, the churn of stat refresh can be aggravating. Is it unfair that an iconic card like Enterprise-E Picard is outpaced by every newer Picard that comes out? Undoubtedly.

But sometimes, it makes a kind of sense, as it does with this card vs. Ambassador Sarek. This is Sarek at the top of his game, before the Bendii Syndrome, before his Las Vegas shotgun wedding to Perrin, before the illicit Vulcan finger kissing scandals and as such, he scores a whole bushel of collections, a reasonable voyage score, and can even unlock Quinn from his frozen comet in Episode 10. With early game usability and superlative long term value, Sarek is a recommended grab for everyone.
