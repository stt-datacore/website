Ok, now everyone can put Grat on your bridge with several variants of Archer and call it a Quantum Leap bridge crew.  Hurrah!

Finally, a Legendary Tandaran (said no one ever)!  What’s up with WRG releasing big SEC bases one after another?  Well, here’s another one.  Grat debuts at about rank 100 for Voyages, which seems to be about the sweet spot now that Chances Taken Kirk and Mirror Tuvok pushed up the top ranks.  Maybe Power Creep is slowing?

Unfortunately, this suspicious Tandaran Colonel has few strong attributes except perhaps a +15 Accuracy boost on ships with a Position Trigger and a trio of debut Collections, along with 4 more likely to come as the months go by and WRG continues to deliver regular “content” via promised new sets of crew to collect.
