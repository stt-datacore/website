A slower Ardra with trigger required. Ah yes, that's what we'll use him for. It's hard to find a ton of equity hiding in this clone's Magic Eye outfit (I think I see a sailboat), but almost any crew offers something in the realms of collections and events.

Weyoun's best case scenario in those areas won't blow anyone away, but at least he already has multiple collections and he does technically have variants to help bolster, however slightly, possible event work. This card is more of a pick for Combs' Clan fanatics, though he may save your bacon in a particularly poor behold.
