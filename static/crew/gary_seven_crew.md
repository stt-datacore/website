DB pulled off a real (un)balancing act with Gary to give him a great base, monstrous voyage numbers (with a useful skill set), and the #2 overall proficiency total including the top SCI/SEC gauntlet pair. If he beams onto your ship, drop what you're doing and spend your next 200k honor to fuse him.
