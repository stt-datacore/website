Ripper's value is highly volatile and is event and roster depe...oh wait hang on, that's the other Disco SEC/SCI workhorse. Like her macro-tardigrade cousin, Airiam’s uses are limited for a shuttle filler with only two skills. Disco events are numerous but if you have been playing since Discovery launched no doubt you will be inundated with faction fodder.

There's enough meat on her trait set to offer workhorse status in spurts, as demonstrated by her unexpected SEC dominance during the Astrophysicist mega, but the lack of a third skill to fill out her hefty primary and secondary skills should give one pause before adding her to your roster over candidates with broader utility.
