This is more like what the Orla Brady faithful were hoping to see from Laris’ debut contribution to Timelines. Saddle up, Lock and Laris aims her rifle at anything that’ll move the needle; events, daily shuttles, voyages…

The Romulan anti-matter trait has confounded WRG employees for years, causing them to print cards like Elnor and Senator Vreenak to fill that elusive seat. Outside of Romulan Data’s debut sometime during the Holy Roman Crusades, Laris might be the best chance to realize that extra bit of voyage bump thanks to a usable raw power and handful of supplementary AM traits. Her skill set will drop her value there like a stone, but as we’ve seen with voyage calculator outputs in the past, this trait in particular should earn her a reprieve longer than others.

Laris’ skill set value flip flops for shuttles, however. The top SEC offering for every possible event trait aside from Brutal (fittingly) is guaranteed to ride whatever weekend bonus shuttles she can scare up. With excellent base metrics overall and skills conducive to daily shuttles, she should hold down work there with aplomb.

A fourth paragraph? Why not, she comes pre-loaded with four collections after all. A few other less likely traits may bump that total up in the future, but she hardly needs them with her other attributes working in concert to produce one of the more useful CMD/DIP/SUCK options in the game.
