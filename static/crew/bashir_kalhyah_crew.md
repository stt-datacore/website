If you're in the habit of skimming over base and voyage ranks, Judo Chop Kal'HYAH Bashir may be a hidden gem. A handful of stat-boosting collections, while increasingly common, is great value that doesn't get power creeped quite like numbers in other areas of the game. Sharing company with the esteemed Antaak as the only Klingon Physicians in the game (An unlikely pair, how would they have reacted to each other we wonder?) is just the tip of this oddball iceberg.

In fact his voyage prowess is built on that. MED + Klingon, SEC + Physician...uncommon pairings and exploitable niches are often the driving force behind pushing crew into service and in this case elevate numbers for Bashir which aren't eye-catching.

It's the same story for events where Bashir's more common SEC/CMD pairing qualifies him for the most frequent shuttle seats. Bashir and Physicians at large aren't flush with options for those skill bases, further cementing his all-round usage. Kal'HYAH might have debuted in the long shadow of Dexa, RSK, and Human Saru, but has ended up being one of the best crew released in 2021.
