Frankly, it feels weird to rank a crew such as Koosh ball. There's too big a gulf in value from playstyle to playstyle and what Tribble offers is a series of peaks and valleys. He (yes, there's a hidden male trait) won't voyage for you or ever set foot in the arena, yet there's a certain level of flexibility for a crew who dominates ten of the eleven shuttle seats for which they're eligible. Because of his narrow nature, you'll really want to go all the way with fusing Tribble and not stop at his introductory one star price tag.

If your experience with one-skill wonder Bones has been positive, ask your doctor if Captain Tribble is right for you. There's a small bump in base power comparatively and a nearly three-to-one edge for CMD seating over MED on event shuttles. As a 'screwdriver' crew, Tribble is a situational powerhouse. You just have to decide if shuttles are the situation in which you want to succeed.
