Players have gotten years of use out of Zefram's strong ENG base, but as happens over time, it's begun slipping down the ranks. Now dwarfed by three different mega legendaries, its chances for use are shrinking by the week. His strong showing in the pilot mega gave him a spark of life and is a good reminder to acquire traits when possible, but the future is not likely to be as kind to him as the past has been, especially since the 2020 Caregiver/Warp Theorist mega taps out his last viable trait - so far as we can tell, at least. A great skill set languishes near the bottom of the voyage power ranks and is more of a desperation asset if your roster is overrun with CMD/DIP/SEC. His double collections are a tempting carrot, but poor overall numbers make the trek to five stars less worthwhile than for almost any new option.
