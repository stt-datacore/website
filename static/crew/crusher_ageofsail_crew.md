Crusher has a couple glaring weaknesses like event chances and raw voyage numbers, but those can be excused because MED primaries are simply more rare than other skills. MED/CMD in particular will welcome her aboard their voyage runs. Her strong proficiency total may be spread a bit too thin for our liking, but two ranked pairs are good enough for a couple months' work on young rosters.
