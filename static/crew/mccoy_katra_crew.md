A strong option for years, Katra has clearly, sadly peaked. His power doesn’t afford a MED-led Skill set any Voyage leash and despite a pair of Collections, which hundreds of crew now have, there’s little room for expansion there.

Outside of day one Gauntlet use for new players, you’ll be looking to Katra for Event work. His stable Event history includes a few features in different Event types and given his age, he’s probably likely to snag a few more in the future. If there are enough MED seats for Katra to pitch in, break the old boy out of mothballs and take a ride to planet forbidden.
