Medic's respectable voyage MED is paired with two trickier skill combos to give him 8+ hour staying power in the face of a sinking overall score. Boasting multiple Paris events in each calendar year, this particular variant has also struck big bonus feature gold four times, making a MED skill that sometimes struggles to find shuttle seating a high-impact tool. With the advent of the Costume Party collection, Tom slows his value slide caused by sinking ranks and ends up being a well-rounded super rare with something to offer everyone.
