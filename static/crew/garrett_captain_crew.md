If you're a glass half full player, Captain Garrett may not look as bad to you as some. Five non-HFS traits is a bounty and though a few seem less likely to garner WRG's attention than others, the Resourceful collection has taught us, 'Eyes open, Veer.'

Until that happens, she's unfortunately a total dud who won't sniff daily work and offers only infrequent, sporadic event chances.
