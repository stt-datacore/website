Guinan herself would tell you that this card has no meaning in the Nexus. Her MED-led skill set is sabotaged on voyages due to a lack of power and there’s really no meat on the bone in any other attribute save for a best case trait revival scenario. A top-ish MED base and above average count of collection-eligible traits leave her fate in the hands of a 63 year old overweight Bill Shatner. I mean in WRG’s hands.

Some of those same traits which have made “Guinan gauntlets” such an annoyance to players over the years sadly won’t do much to elevate this variant’s awful proficiencies. Sooner or later you’ll be forced to behold her, because, eh….traits, but it probably won’t be the most exciting fifteen seconds of your life.
