Gary "Gary motherfuckin' Seven" Seven had gone roughly three years between Big Book note changes. Are we criminally understaffed and possibly lazy? Yes. Has Gary been such a colossal fixture of the game that he's remained elite for over three years? Yes.

Gary's known on a first name basis to players, much like Grebnedlog and Minuet. Except...in a good way. A voyage deity, Gary only began flirting with a double-digit voyage rank after completing a full three-year tour which likely won't even account for half the time he'll be in service on your roster. He matches any voyage downsides (a not uncommon skill set and only four traits) with big upsides; 100% of his traits appear as anti-matter bonuses, the order of his skills is great, and he has big ol' power.

Gary loads torpedo tube two with a potent gauntlet warhead. A trio of ranked pairs including the top overall SEC/SCI roll are supported by two huge single rolls that give him underrated flexibility to avoid having to wait for just the right skill combo to pop up like most 2-skillers do. While not oppressively strong like certain gauntlet exclusives or boasting a number of high crit gauntlets, Gary is a versatile choice to shore up multiple skills at once.

As Mr. Seven begins to tumble from the apex of his powers, CollectionMania may be the wind beneath his wings to keep him aloft. One of his less likely traits, Resourceful, has already secured him a chunk of stat-boosting value with more possible. And although he's been an event dud so far, he still retains the top SCI base for his two likeliest trait events; hero and undercover operative.
