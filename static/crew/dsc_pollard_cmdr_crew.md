Don't talk about the art, don't talk about the art, don't talk about - ohhhhhhhhhh maaaaaaaaaaan. If you've ever doubted that WRG employs at least two artists, take a look at Pollard here, then take a gander at Princess Thalia and Runa, and tell me the same person made them both; I have a bridge on Romulus I'd like to sell you. A somewhat flavourless card, Pollard is a decent enough voyager with just about the right amount of juice to put in some work, though she's a far cry from the supercharged cards we've been seeing lately, and all it would take is a mega card with MED/SCI to ohhhhhh wait. 

Hmm. 

Well, you know what they say, you can't rely on just one card to be able to properly stack a voyage - newer rosters will likely fly Kovich and Pollard together, while older rosters will find her an easy freeze and forget with +4 collection notches for the associated build cost, since there isn't a ton else she offers otherwise. Almost makes you wish for the days when a different Pollard was pretty much an auto-include on every voyage. Very different times indeed . . .
