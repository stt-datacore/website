In the same mega event that gave us “Rescue Team Uhura” we get “Uhura In Yellow!”. I can’t complain too much about this card. Her DIP score overtakes Florist Q for the #4 position and her voyage score is sufficient enough to warrant a few trips away. She does take the #1 spot for DIP/CMD shuttles, assuming of course you don’t have a plethora of crew in those categories, and certainly will contribute towards the weekend cadet missions. Uhura is good to have on developing rosters but don’t expect to keep her around for too long once the bigger Super Rare and Legendary cards start dropping.
