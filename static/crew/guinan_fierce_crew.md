A crew Exclusive to Voyage three-part Dilemmas and a Dilemma Achievement, Fierce Guinan is both inevitable and elusive. But is she necessary? Seeing as I get paid by the word, read on...

Fierce has actually improved in value over time. While there have been a few ugly stretches where the Gauntlet RNG machine was stuck on Bartender, she was never more than an oddity there, useful for breaking up the coin flipping tedium. And while she can still offer some nice Crit values for younger rosters, it's the rest of her Trait tie-ins that pique our interest.

A pair of Collections as of this writing already has a lot of Super Rare Citations burning holes in folks' Inventories and her potential ceiling there is sky high, no matter how esoteric the Traits seem otherwise. That's partly why she hasn't gained much of an Event foothold outside of Survivalist Mega Events, but that also seems like an area where she could and maybe should improve in.

Fierce is a forward-thinking player's type of crew. Valuable enough now on the back of her Collections to merit the effort to Immortalize, but with a high potential value ceiling.
