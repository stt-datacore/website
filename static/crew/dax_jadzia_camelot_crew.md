This crew note update for the Royal will be the first one that isn't absolutely glowing. Greater SCI bases and a plethora of strong(er) voyagers have brought her down to earth a bit, which is how you'd describe an event count that will likely never again reach 2017's lofty tally of seven. You'll still have plenty of chances to relieve her of collection duties and thaw this capable event shuttler, but her punch lacks the power that it once had, leaving her mid-level for daily work with fairly worthwhile long term value.
