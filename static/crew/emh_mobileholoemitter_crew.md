Doc spent a while cultivating the reputation of having a great base MED. Unfortunately for him, Cornwell and later BR Bashir undid that work in a month. He's still owns a respectable event count, thanks mainly to his traits, but outside of those weekends you're looking at five beholds of value to construct a crew that barely pulls even with two very commonly owned cards. And despite MED's relative lack of options, you never want to see a voyage total like that. Events and skill set scarcity guarantee him some work, but with a general lack of MED shuttle seats, temper expectations for daily work.
