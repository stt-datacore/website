A wonderful marriage of character story with in-game crew, Zimmerman takes getting rejected by Leeta so poorly that he voyages away from DS9 as far and as fast as possible - we reap the benefits.

In(no)vader Zim debuted as a top ten (unboosted) voyager with a whopping seven anti-matter traits and frankly not much skill set competition outside of The Red Angel. His profile in that area should be bringing home a 3-4 year return on investment, not even including his collection considerations.

The other cupboards aren't totally bare as his workman's pair of bases should spot-fill daily shuttles or even shine during the rare chances he gets at weekend work. If you don't mind the 'face color matches his clothing' aesthetic he shares with The Hansens, go out of your way to acquire and fuse this foundational voyage piece.
