There was a really fun read here a few years ago. Clever jokes and whatnot. Let me save you the time - this card sucks. Her parents even forgot she existed in Picard season three. A three meat collection pizza (bunnycorn not among them) is possible if she snags a show mega and/or a few lucky traits hit, but until they do, feel free to continue to ignore her in beholds.
