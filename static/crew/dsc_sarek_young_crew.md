While vanilla Sarek has dropped off the map for voyages and his event count is somewhat backwards looking, he's still a multi-faceted crew with something to offer most players. Early game rosters will welcome aboard a strong, fast-activating attack boost while veterans chasing collections will find plenty of meat on the bones of his trait lineup.

With DIP seating always in plentiful supply, he should continue to carve out some measure of weekend work, even if it's not the eight per year he was spoiled with at the height of the Disco mega era.
