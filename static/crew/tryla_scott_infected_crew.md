Captain Scott’s (no, the other one) theme is budget. Just like Riker’s bluegill, Tryla is a budget piece to get the job done cheaply, though perhaps not always get the job done well.

An Ardra-lite arena option, Scott is fine as a fast-activating accuracy boost, but is missing the hammer damage that two scoops of crit bonus will afford you. Similarly in gauntlet, she’ll help new rosters get their collective foot in the door of that increasingly cutthroat game mode thanks to competent rolls and an absurd number of elevated crit gauntlets - just don’t expect her to stack too many wins against exclusives or crew built for gauntlet like Lt. Commander Mitchell.

She’s nothing resembling a regular shuttle pilot, but at least has some wiggle room on voyages. First, though, the words of caution. Scott’s “pretty good” debut voyage rank is only good for 16th in her skill set. Oops, 17th. She was bettered by another crew literally five minutes after release. When you consider that nine different skill sets don’t even have seventeen legendary options in the game, you start to see how competition might be a problem, both for existing and yet-to-exist names.

Well-rounded in many areas and with some interesting traits, Scott is a bell curve cite option. Finish her if you’re brand new for the utility, look for better options in the mid-game, and perhaps buying a few collections with one cite for late game, boost-stacking players is the way to go.
