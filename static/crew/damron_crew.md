Shoutout to all the hardcore Xindi fans, holding out for years for a new card to bolster those huge numbers of....*checks notes*...7 examples in the game.  Your Christmas is here in July!  Well, maybe you weren’t totally good this year, because Santa isn’t bringing you coal, but it isn’t a shiny new Red Rider Pump Action BB Gun.

Enter into the game Damron – useful to newer accounts or Nightmare Mode™ players, but otherwise from overflowing rosters to the most seasoned, this killer won’t find much use, especially at only 3 stars from his Faction Event.

Stat creep is real, and not only in the world of Golds.  Had Damron been released Six months ago, he would be a great card for early to mid-game players to use on Voyages.  Since that time, some absolutely killer Super-Rare characters have made the release pipe, pushing him down to voyage rank 83 at launch.  Still, he has 4 trait seats that can increase his use.  With only 2 Collections and a barely usable +6 ATK bonus to ships, you may be finding yourself using a citation to send him to the depths of your freezer.
