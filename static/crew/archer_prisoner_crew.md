A fairly lush trait set headlines this card and although he’s a late bloomer, Archer has the kind of potential that we want to target in beholds that don’t include instant contributors. That same set of traits has hugely buoyed Archer's typically modest event tally, even though his usefulness on weekend shuttles is undercut by curiously weak bases, even for a card his age. He’s a wait and see, but fortune should begin to favor him in the cryo vault before too long.
