The textbook definition of a manufactured triumph, Solok's only possible value to even young rosters has to be his (we hope) eventual addition to the Play Ball vanity collection, and even then, he's probably one of the worst cards there. 

At some point, you have to ask yourself what you're collecting two skill, non-event crew for, and honestly, you're going to run out of good answers for that question. If we ever get an Athlete mega, he will be . . . a pilot. Yessiree, he certainly will be a pilot.
