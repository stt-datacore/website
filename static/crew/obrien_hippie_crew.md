Miles looks like he’s about to ask if “You rang?”, but at least his numbers flatter him much more than his art. A plug-n-play daily option for voyages and shuttles, 420BlazeIt O’Brien also has the charm that makes elderly players swoon; quad collections and bases worth thawing for events. He’s not a particularly elite option in any one area, but top shelf in several and worth your behold capital.
