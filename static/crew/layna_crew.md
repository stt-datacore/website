Layna, I'm begging, darling, please. With desolate event chances tied solely to traits, her bases are likely to be stuck hauling the odd daily shuttle and even then, not until higher star counts given the ubiquity of DIP characters. Her shot at earning a roster spot falls mainly on her voyage contributions. The DIP/SCI pairing is not at all uncommon, but above average numbers will earn her at least some play unless you’ve targeted the numerous similar skill sets from top voyagers. On ships, her 30% attack speed ability is the maximum amount available in game, but more than likely activates too late to give it time to make a difference.
