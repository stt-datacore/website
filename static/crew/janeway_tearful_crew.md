While it’s not 100% clear from Tearful Janeway’s flavor text, this is indeed the Janeway version from the episode “Tuvix”, with its associated moral conundrum explored during the pilot episode of “Prose and Khans” presented by “Trek Time!” (Subscribe NOW!), the popular live stream/pofcast.  Spoiler alert: Judge Q ruled that Janeway was justified in separating/murdering Tuvix, despite the ostensible logical arguments of the esteemed Jenos Idanian.

2019 and 2020 were “The Years of Janeway (events)”, but notedly there has been a dearth of her number being called on the weekend.  That being said, inevitably we will see a return to Janeway events eventually (see what I did there) as she’s a Captain and a fan favorite.  Within those parameters, you’ll see a big DIP base for shuttles, and a strong secondary CMD to help her find seating.

Newer players, if they FF her in the debut event, will find Janeway useful on voyages until they get a strong stable of Legendary crew.  While this is not a unique proposition for any new Super Rare crew, any player should be satisfied to find 2 collections to start off with, and one more Tactician trait that is likely to find a new collection someday.

Just like Tuvix (the crew in Star Trek Timelines), you can Finish, Freeze, and Freakin’ Forget this variant until the bell rings for a Janeway Faction event.
