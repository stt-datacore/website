A character in her sunset years, much the same for her card, and a late autumn foliage theme for her scorecard - the perfect match.

This space had been warning you away from AF T'Pol for a while now and you can see that she hasn't presented the same level of return on investment as other options of the time. Her highlight, events, have been up and down in opportunity, but she's fallen from the top CMD option for variant events and slots in as an event shuttle filler rather than event shuttle star.

Aside from a lone 45% gauntlet, there's not much special about this card. The often overlapped Vulcan/Telepath/Astrophysicist triad may hurt each other when vying for WRG's collection attention, but we've been blindsided by these things before and, given time, T'Pol may indeed make her way into multi-collection territory, including a possible 'Alternate Futures' group.
