Big Julie's bases are not 2021 material, but allowances can be made for a man who is as "on duty" as his third Bloody Mary will allow. Until he debuts in that drinking collection alongside Captain Scott, McCoy scores a lone, albeit important collection spot in the expansive Do No Harm group. 

The other area of note for long time players, event shuttle fodder, is not Julep's strong suit, as previously noted. While he is the top super rare DIP option for the McCoy character, other concurrent bonus crew may leave him sipping Mai Tais in cryo.

Voyager power best left to newer rosters coupled with an increasingly available skill set does grant a certain depth to this card and helps make him a worthwhile pickup as a total package, but his power level is that of a crew who should have debuted a few years earlier.
