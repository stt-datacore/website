Command, Diplomacy and...Engineering? Maximillian Of The Woods is kind of an inverse Queen Po but a more relative comparison would be the Borg Queen, my oh my he keeps royal company! But in order to keep up with the Borg Queen he needs to have some more traits to call on. The raw base and voyage numbers are there to make him usable on most rosters with the requisite number of stars, it's just that the rest of him screams pack filler.

With an Enterprise mega in the rear view, Max is at the mercy of a painfully thin trait set for future Faction bonuses. No doubt you might hear some favorable stories from people who got him 4/5 from his campaign and found the numbers and Diplomat tag extremely helpful, but if you missed out, you'll struggle to justify finishing him when stronger crew come your way.
