Star Trek Picard – Season Three is here baby!  And we are going to hit the ground running and celebrate with the first card the entire galaxy will want – no doubt of their absolute favorite actor from the final run of ‘The Best Generation’ – that’s right, Captain Liam S.....

Oh, we couldn’t get him?

Fine, get me his non-union equivalent.

....Introducing Commander Ro Laren! 

Jokes aside, for a first offering of Picard Season Three, she’s not bad.  She’s not *great* either, but given this is only the third representation of Michelle Forbes in the game over the years, beggars can’t be too picky.  Offered to the players as the Ultimate Campaign Legendary, Ro brings a lot of voyage utility to the table, as well as daily shuttle use for SEC seats.  

Those are the highlights – now the fine print – only one Collection at launch, but a staggering five potential pickups in the future.  Ship/Arena ability is a simple attack boost, so no help to the current meta of Fleet Boss Battles or strong nukes.  For the last few months, we’ve been spoiled with some really strong releases of top-tier offerings.  Unfortunately, Ro is going to remain inside for most players and be an answer to a Jeopardy question in the future – “This character returned to Star Trek after 30 years, only filming for 26 minutes and being paid in Tim Hortons, and then died on the way back to her home planet”.  Even the Biggest, Largest, Hugest of Jeopardy players would get that right.
