L'rell's inagural note warned of an overcrowded DIP skill and the tenuousness of Discovery megas continuing. Since then, Disco megas seem to have indeed stopped, while that DIP base has tumbled dozens of ranks as more DIP primaries join the game hourly. Not all hope is lost, though. L'Rell's voyage power is fine for her age and even if event work will be spotty moving forward, her spot in two collections which still need legendary crew to complete is a handy value buoy and makes her an above average behold target as we all crawl toward the bevy of boosts provided by collections.
