Don’t let Yates’ inclusion in the Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang *divert* you from the facts; she’s a terrible crew. Even if it were 2021 and Scapegoat O’Brien was still a Tier 1 crew, that would not change the fact that this card is garbo. The worst Skill set in the game is coupled with more than faded Voyage power, basically no variant Events, and only two viable Traits for Collections or Trait-based weekend work.
