Stranded Quark is several years old now, but he still looks like a crew we’d be happy to see released today. He continually punches above his weight class on voyages due to a fortuitous skill set and handful of rare anti-matter traits while his event tally and number of viable collection traits all promise enduring value.

Newer players should squeeze a little bit of gauntlet use out of his trio of 45% sets and by the time you manage to fuse him up, he should have another dozen events and a few more collections under his thermal blanket-wrapped belt.
