MMA OWO, as she will inevitably become known (just wait, it'll happen), is a crew that you don't need to have, but if you have her, you might use her sometimes.  Yes, what a glowing recommendation!

She debuts with a tired and overstuffed skillset and order, along voyage power that will keep her off your voyages unless somehow you've missed bunches of the better CMD/DIP/SEC crew that have been given away or are available easily via Crew Retrieval, but she has a chance to match Gambler or Crafty antimatter bonus seats.

Owo has no Gauntlet prowess to speak of, and the ship ability is nothing to write home about, but with a +10 attack at 6s she could find some work.

The only place Owo could truly shine is (future) collections.  She'll have Displaced like all S3-S4 USS Discovery crew that traveled to the future, and we could see her hit up to 5 more collections in the coming years.  Too bad she just missed the Crafty mega by literally one week!
