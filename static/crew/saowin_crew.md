Listen, if you are going up against George Costanza you had better have the power to back it up with. Blue meanie certainly does have a numerical advantage over other crew in his class, however they are not quite in the right areas to provide any meaningful difference over other, better crew.

He potentially has some use in shuttles on the incredible rare chance that one of his four traits might theoretically appear in an event sometime in the future. But then he would be fighting for a seat over both Graduation and Prospect Burnham who sequentially are more powerful and feature much more often. He’s a less useful Feezal Phlox, an inferior Indignant Seven, a  vastly terrible...well, you get the idea.
