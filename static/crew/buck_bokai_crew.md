His name is Buck and he’s here to party. Already a strong collection option, Buck's found his niche and should stick with it. Rounding out a sextet of collections would be awesome value for a super rare and his event clip seems likely to pick up as well with a handful of non-HFS traits in tow. Even if you don't use him day to day, he's one of the better long term value prospects from the minor leagues.
