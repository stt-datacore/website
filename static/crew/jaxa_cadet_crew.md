An all-in-one cadet package, Cadet Sito (she doesnâ€™t accept the distortion of her name either) is the premier CMD option for weekday cadet work. Your CMD options are the one skill Ro or a few different CMD secondaries if you want to hit on eligibility five days a week, leaving Sito the best option by far.

Her DIP secondary can squeak by a few nodes on Epic, while her string of traits offers myriad galaxy map node unlocks as well as yet unrealized collection value. This is a card whose value surpasses surface level metrics and is an excellent early game pickup to jumpstart your roster.
