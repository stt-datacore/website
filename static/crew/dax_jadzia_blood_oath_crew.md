Her art makeover from melted crayon to hatchet man was the most exciting thing this Jadzia had done in ages, but her arguably generous inclusion in the Klingon kollection has given her value a spark. While voyage power, base oomph, gauntlet, or arena are all missing in action, she's at least worth snagging for mid-game event work and a Stellar collection spot.

Formerly exploitable niches of voyage skill set and lack of Dax SEC are both hamstrung by a sinking relative power. She's a warm shuttle body if you lack for bonus crew, but in an event with a big pool, she may not be worth the merits to re-enlist.
