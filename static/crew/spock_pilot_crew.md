I really hope you have stocked up on IDICs, Tactical Alerts and Security Codes because Spock is absolutely horrible to equip. Once you get over the shocking amount of replications you just had to endure then Spock is actually fairly decent voyage stock. SEC/CMD is a popular combination but Spock does them both very well. But requiring roughly an average of 7k chrons to immortalise, I think it's cheaper to wait for better crew to drop...
