A different flavour of Archer from a different time. A time of daring, a time of reaching beyond the limits. An Archer that will fly right into the Danger Zone. Which is another way of saying that this Archer is a little different, sporting a unique and rather hefty SCI base in an amount that should catch a ride for the (rare) Archer Faction event. With voyage power in its twilight, look for his notch in the Inspiring collection to tide you over between shuttle test flights.
