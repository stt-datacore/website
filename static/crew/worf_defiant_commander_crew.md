Worf's brand name will win him some fans, but unless he expands on his three previous big-bonus features, a pair of dishonorable bases aren't going to win him much Faction event seating in the future. Luckily, the Klingon collection has given him and his variants some long term value that should persist for several years. Slow arena crit and gauntlet proficiencies for players just starting out are mere garnish to his collection spot and fairly regular event bonuses.
