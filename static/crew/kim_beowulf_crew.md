Let's be real - Grendel would have kicked Beowulf Kim's ass without breaking a sweat. Kim's voyage rank is somewhere in the thousands and his bases, also garbage, are irrelevant too. Two and a half Factions for Kim variants in the entirety of the game is shocking for someone with nine events and his traits, two of which already had their chance in 2018, are ballooning in representation, possibly never to be seen again.

His collection spot, the only positive of note, requires five copies of a terrible crew to win one copy of a mid-level crew. Collectors don't seem to have a problem giving fair haven to Maggie O'Halloran's boyfriend, but if you're looking to upgrade any part of your game, let Beowulf rot in the holobuffers until Doc comes to the rescue.
