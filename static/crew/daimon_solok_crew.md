A thoroughly shameful crew premiere that will have him washing up on the shore next to all the other flotsam. This Solok card lays claim to stats four years older than its age and is (borderline) useless in almost every daily area of the game, which is a perfectly valid claim to make in an era where you can retrieve any type of crew you desire and 99% of legendary crew debut above this power level.

Completely by coincidence, Solok's best area of potential potency amidst WRG's big collection push is his trait lineup. Having hit on a few collections already, the rest of his list excludes the most bloated groups and all have a chance to bump up his value in that area going forward or put his poor bases in a shuttle seat for two to four days at a time.
