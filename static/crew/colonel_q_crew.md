A refreshingly different arena ability grabs the lede - a hefty accuracy boost activating at a snappy three seconds. If you like to win with your favorites and own Patch Adams on DVD, this is your guy. Beyond that he's a part time shuttle pilot who benefits from a good skill order to find plenty of seating opportunities when one of his traits is called. That same trait lineup, once thought to be somewhat thin, is benefitting from WRG's collection push and has been incrementally adding value to the Colonel over time.
