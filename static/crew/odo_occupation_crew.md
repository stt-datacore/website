With the highest Common SEC and some very useful Traits for unlocking Nodes, Odo fills the Cardassian Collection and will assist in the Tuesday Cadet Missions. Sadly his Ship ability is pretty poor and being SEC only means his usefulness is limited past a certain point. As a long-term investment, a player can hope to see his other three Traits achieve corresponding Collections to give him a grand slam.
