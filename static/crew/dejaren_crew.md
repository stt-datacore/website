A crew from Voyager that’s actually a good...voyager, huzzah he’s worthwhile for both out-going missions and wholesale mass murder! Whilst SEC/CMD is a common combination that most players will get plenty of over time, few can pass the bar for staying power on voyages.

The classic long-term potential from variant events or collections is missing, however he does have a speedy 200% damage boost at six seconds which is sure to turn a few heads in the Arena. Don’t expect to see him on many shuttle seats outside of trait bonus weekends, however, as his bases don’t quite hit the levels to compete with low fused golds, but the fused stats measure up well.
