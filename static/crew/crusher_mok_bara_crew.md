Considering some of the constraints of Crusher’s character-building opportunities and the male dominated storylines throughout much of Trek, all hail this two-birds-with-one-stone Bev variant. 

Her four-pack of viable traits alongside the mundane HFS tags give Crusher probably her best collection and event value to date, aside from the Mirror Universe’s heavy lifting. While only one of the four, Physician, triggers an anti-matter bonus, that’s actually enough for a crew with a heavy amount of MED and sublime overall voyage metrics. You’re looking at several years of voyage use from Mok’bara on almost any roster.

Her other dabs of utility don’t overwhelm, but as mentioned previously come in above most other Bev variants. Event bonuses in spurts and a modest collection profile should be easy assets to push you over the hump of acquiring Bev if you haven’t done so already.
