Possessed by his imaginary friend, Danny stands at the foot of Wendy’s bed, stroking the long, sharp blade. He chants the strange word over and over. The boy pivots, walks slowly to the dresser and grasps a phaser in his hand. Briefly checking to make sure it’s set on stun for maximum safety, he lifts his arm and the weapon’s beam carves a single word into the wooden door. Startled awake suddenly, Wendy snatches the weapon out of the boy's hand and glimpses in the reflection of a mirror the message he left… KALLIR!

Damn, I really thought we were onto something there. Regardless, the President’s Killer base and trait combination benefits her in a few different ways and makes for Über campaign crew #2 who’s appealing in a different way than the prototype Laris.

Four collections on release is apparently all the justification needed to shell out cash, but in this case they do, at a minimum, add significant value to her in the eyes of many elderly players. The other notable avenues for Rillak’s traits to contribute will come in periodic mega events and one-offs where her huge CMD score will see her shipping out on the first wave of shuttles. And for voyages, the crater in the ground known as the Cardassian anti-matter seat has zero competition, so the Prez will be your default choice for trait matching.
