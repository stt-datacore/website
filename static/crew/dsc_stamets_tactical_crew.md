Voyages are the highlight of Stamets' portfolio - his skill set is underrepresented both in terms of power and options, with only a single former mega among them. He and Leucon are really the only names in that skill set who you'd want to acquire solely for their voyage considerations, but he has a bit more to offer.

Stamets should be good for a few events per year even with a supporting trait list pointed directly at voyage antimatter rather than surprise event bonuses. And despite not topping 25% crit in any gauntlet, his worthwhile SEC/ENG pair won't often face walls and lets you take plenty of shots at 2-for-1ing The Caretaker as a diet version of Gangster Spock or ATB.
