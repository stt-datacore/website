On paper Vorik seems to be fairly reasonable with a #12 base stat which goes up to 800+ when maxed out. However his base stat is the worst among 3* crew and his single skill stat makes him the second worst voyager after Jake Sisko. His ship skills is standard for most engineers and will score 20% hull repair but it decreases the attack score by 2. Keep him if you are hunting for Vulcans but if you have to airlock him it won’t be long before he pops up again.
