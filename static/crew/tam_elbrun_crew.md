Who Whatman? Tan Elbow? He comes from an episode with a lot of heart, but Elbrun's value is paper thin in game. If you're the Scarecrow or Cowardly Lion and want to use your pal's pal, Tam gets a single 45% gauntlet and a respectable pair roll within it. Beyond that he's merely a wonky trait set which is probably going to pick up a collection or two eventually, but he debuts without any.
