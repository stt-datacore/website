The best Aenar in game just by virtue of being an easily obtainable purple and having a third skill, Hemmer's debut card is a case in point that just because you're the best at something, you unfortunately aren't necessarily good. A desirable skill set for voyages is hampered by power that simply doesn't cut it for 2022 Super Rare crew, and with the outlook for SNW events being unsure, he can't rely on an event worthy ENG base to bolster him where it matters most. For many, Hemmer is merely the +1 towards finishing Andorian that means you don't have to finish one of the heinous gold crew - but then again, there isn't a part of the scorecard designed to showcase just how valuable that is, so take the tier with a grain of salt. And for those of you hoping for a more voyage capable gold version of Bruce Horak's grumpy engineer, keep your socks on and your antennae untwisted; better variants are sure to come.
