Players go crazy 'bout a sharp dressed (wo)man! *Guitar Riff*

The Commander is still an event force with a number of yearly variant events and enough traits to make a difference, but beyond that she's sort of become yesterday's news. Below average voyage work "highlights" the rest of a card which includes a perfunctory collection and molasses arena ability. She's earned her reputation over the years, but if you're looking to acquire her now, it's merely as an event piece, particularly with the waves of CMD/DIP/SEC megas DB throws at us.
