You can almost hear some cartoonish villain taunting Mirror T'Pol with labels of "old" and "weak" and it's regrettably true. She's buried behind a couple different walls for her two ranked gauntlet pairs and her voyage numbers nearly have her cozying up to some 2-skill crew. While more useful for new players, she'll find herself edged out for daily use on established rosters.

But where she comes into relevance are events and collections. Three megas, a handful of trait events, and a half dozen T'Pol events (two features) for which she has two variant-best bases all constitute a considerable amount of work with traits that offer the mirage/promise of more. Two currently valuable collection spots have upped her worth in recent times, granting her non-standard behold consideration if you're sick of chasing the new top #X base of the week.
