It's always exciting to witness the birth of a new trope. Geordi earnestly saying there's a problem on the holodeck in The Big Goodbye... Janeway fresh off the boat from Kalto province wearing a shirt that says 'Screw the Temporal Prime Directive'... So what better way to celebrate the on-ramp of the road to Captain Braxton's eventual therapy trip than the addition of the long-requested 'Stripy Shirt Janeway'?

She hits the right notes for your typical base/event/voyage crew, starting with variant events second to n(one). Lacking some shiny variant-best honorific, she simply will hold down the abundant SCI and DIP seats for Janeway events with aplomb. You might miss the gaudy event count of a Discovery or trait-rich crew, but her sterling faction rate has provided similar value to those options thus far.

On voyages, a clutch SEC tertiary helps her avoid a few bloated SCI/DIP groups and in combination with strong overall power, gives her daily voyage prospects and adds her to the long list of serviceable-to-great Janeway variants.
