A card I struggled to hate but I just can’t. He is the #2 Voyage crew for all 3* crewmembers and despite him sporting yet another SEC/CMD combination, he does them well enough to secure his place on most of your outgoing voyages. If you are running a ship with cloak the +1250 critical bonus will be welcome if paired with some damage dealers. As much as I don’t like the character I find it hard not to recommend him based purely on aesthetics but if I was to fault him it would be that his base stats and proficiencies are easily beaten. But don’t let that stop you adding him to your voyage roster.
