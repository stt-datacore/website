Likely to be overshadowed by his alter-ego Mirror Stamets, Nav is still worthy crew in his own right. His strong Disco ENG is a significant attribute with DB's willingness to launch wave after wave of event bonuses. Poor traits hamstring some of his flexibility, but above average voyage power is still strong enough to trump many older crew which makes Navigator a fine investment for players looking to pick up useful event/voyage combos.
