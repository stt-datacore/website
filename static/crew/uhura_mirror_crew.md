Lumped in with the other purple Mirorr dregs isn't quite fair to this Uhura. She has some collection value with traits other than simply Terran Empire and beyond that she does an Ardra-lite impression in the arena, offers some fairly reliable event bonuses (with admittedly poor bases), and even owns four different 45% crit trait sets in the gauntlet.

She's absolutely on the weak side due to age, but a must-have for a stat-boosting collection taht brings her other offerings into the limelight again on young rosters.
