In this book of truth we only display acts of absolute candor, therefore I am honor bound by service in the Qowat Milat to tell you...we don’t need more Picard variants if they look like this. Light on both traits and usability, this is a card whose first star comprises the bulk of his value.

Owning respectable proficiencies for a super rare, Vashti does alright as a transitional piece for fresh rosters looking to break into the gauntlet. The biggest detractor here would be skill set competition, but his short list of traits are about as common as they come for gauntlet crit bonuses and he can make waves for new players at 45% crit.

There’s not much meat on the bone otherwise. Of his three “viable” traits, Desperate and Civilian may be too large to ever catch an event bonus and are surely near the back of the line for future collections. With proficiencies sucking up most of his stat budget, Vashti’s bases are uncompetitive options to thaw for events, even though he catches bonuses fairly regularly. In short, the first star of this card early on will find room for work, but take your sweet time adding the last three.
