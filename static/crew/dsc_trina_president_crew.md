As a certain Scottish engineer put it, "It's like the first time you fall in love. You don't ever love a woman quite like that again." T'Rina is almost the epitome of this concept, or at least, how it translates to Timelines. Confused? Good. At time of writing, as of her debut, she will likely never be as good again as she is right now, and you will never use her quite as much as you will if you decide to immortalise her straight away - this isn't a crew that gets better with time. Her voyage rank is right in the 'good enough' range, no thanks to the CMD/DIP PRI/SEC, and that helpful dob of ENG in concert with her non-standard traits (not even Federation!) means she has no complete overlap with another crew - for now. 

Her collections are quite literally about to tap out with the incoming Discollection, since Telepath likely has too much overlap with Vulcan to be viable, and Politician doesn't quite 'feel' right, though we'd be happy to be wrong. Her base is decent but unremarkable anywhere outside of a Disco mega - funny how that works, idn'it? - and the ship ability is good for Arena, but the timing aspect of it may make it untenable for all but the most ardent of experimenters. Outside of some weird, First Officer Chekov-esque change of circumstances through some random quirk of fate, right now, and the next 6-12 months are the best time to finish and use her. Will you? Because if you don't, well . . . here's to President T'Rina's future - an old girlfriend we'll never meet again, outside of a cryostasis vault.
