In this house, we love and respect Armin Shimmerman - especially when this particularly Principal Synder-esque variant nets a fistful of collections and Quark events with a thaw-able CMD base to boot. He'd almost be useful on ships, too, if not for a pesky attack handicap, but he offers enough value otherwise for a 2-skill super rare. If crew can't bring it in the daily use department, then they can only hope to offer post-fusion value like this. Acquire, you lobeless fool!
