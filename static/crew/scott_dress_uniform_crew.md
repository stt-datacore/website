Not even a good card on release, Scotty's pair of collections (likely the only ones he ever claims) may even make him a better value now than he was back then.

ENG is a skill that hurts for event seating and the Scotty character has a grand total of zero faction events through the game's first six years. If you're stuck in the worst of the worst behold, there's no shame in taking a star on a pair of collection spots you may never finish, but there's no reason to actively seek this crew out.
