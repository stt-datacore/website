One might expect the entry for this joke character to be nothing but silly references to his episode, but that would be stupid. And we are not stupid. We are smart.

Creepy Uncle Greb is a mishmash of useful and humorous. His ENG proficiency and arena ability are certainly referential to his role on-screen, but at the least the former is fairly useful. While the ship battle speed up button may blur the lines between initialization times, faster is still better and Greb's big attack boost coming online at six seconds is usually enough to overcome its short duration in the right setups.

Greb's bases are somewhat at odds with each other. A fittingly pitiful ENG score handicaps any voyage potential, leaving him in the tank alongside bottom barrel 3-skillers, while a pretty substantial DIP base makes him a possible surprise shuttle pilot when/if one of his obscure traits get called for event work. He's the top super rare DIP option for three of his four relevant traits as of this writing.

Trying to use Pakled crew on a daily basis should sound the Red Alarm, but we want to be nothing if not persistent in highlighting the nice niche that Greb should be able to exploit sometime in the future.
