There are some attributes of note here - particularly a middling collection value and four-day-a-week cadet eligibility, but as far as the latter goes, only his SEC primary is made of strong enough stuff to handle critting epic cadet missions with ease.

With his traits only relevant for DIP unlocks on the galaxy map, you may struggle to find reasons to keep Noggles on your active roster. Feel free to airlock him a few times before swinging back in a shuttlecraft to immortalize him as a perfunctory collection notch in the future.
