Your garden variety filler card has been power creeped, not leaving much value behind. A hefty chunk of crit rating at four seconds with better than average passive stats for the arena is probably Leeta's only useful daily attribute.

But the Mirror trait has given her fistfuls of events while remaining a small enough pool of crew to be called upon again. With Mirror, Bajoran, and Romantic all reasonable collection traits, she's a low-end dart throw who could pay off after an equivalent daily use super rare gets frozen. Not bad for Chase Masterson's easiest paycheck.
