Pulaski is simply not worth it in any respect and the Dah-ta will back that up. Narrow usage for cadet missions one day per week and a lone collection won’t do much to stretch your food dollar if you’re economizing your trainers in the early game. If you do need MED help, look for markers of great utility - a third skill, stronger traits, or a tier rating in the single digits.
