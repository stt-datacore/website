An Episode 8 reward, it wouldn't hurt to select Weyoun early on if you don't want Karr for the Gauntlet - Weyoun (and a few others) can unlock a Dominion/DIP Node in that same episode. There's not a ton of value beyond that outside of Collections (three). Despite appearing in a few dozen episodes of DS9, Weyoun doesn't get much Event love. And although, theoretically, any of his Traits not starting with the letter V could pop for a few bonuses in the future, Weyoun doesn't really have Bases worth thawing.
