Worf is holding one half of a pugil stick from American Gladiators™ and ready to thwap O’Brien, Bashir, Sisko, Martok, and Alexander with it. WRG also thwapped players with this Honor Hall release in February 2022, and thwapped us greatly they did. 

Worf debuted with a decent Skill set and the power to use it (after being shamed for only having four Traits on debut), but has aged quickly and is no longer worth his salt on Voyages. Left as a Collection and Event crew, he easily will find himself Faction Shuttle seating with his CMD and SEC bases given the propensity of Faction Missions to include those Skills, and Worf is evergreen for Events, Trait bonuses notwithstanding. 

On the Collections front, a trio of inclusions as it stands plus up to three more in contention for future WRG content updates™ gives Kal’Hyah Worf consideration from Collectionphiles everywhere… but with similar crew available in the Time Portal, is he worth 100,000 Honor and four Legendary Citations?
