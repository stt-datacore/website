A former daily use Hoss, Presage stood out among her peers at release, even amidst a crazy stretch of power crew at the 2018/2019 turn. Time has worked its voodoo on this crew, but there's still enough usage to justify the behold capital. Alongside legitimate four or five collection potential and edge case gauntlet ability for younger rosters, Presage is a versatile crew who's doing an admirable job fighting back against stat creep.
