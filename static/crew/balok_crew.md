Balok is not cut from the Red Angel or Locutus cloth in that he won't dominate several areas of the game, but inside the mauler's pit, he does share their company in terms of raw gauntlet power. He was mighty mighty before release, but Brickhouse Balok was granted a few tailored crit trait sets post-release to help him achieve his final form.

Four 65% sets (as many as all other exclusives combined) and four 45% sets are an unnecessary number of opportunities for this CMD monster to completely manhandle the rest of the field. The only top gauntlet name who comes close to that sort of crit potential is the former best CMD gauntleteer - Kahless. Those two will recreate the legendary battles of Kahless and Molor as they vie for your attention to make your Fave Five, but with Balok as the numerical favorite in the majority of situations, that may be a big nail in Kahless' coffin of those who shun his 100,000 honor price point.

As alluded to, a poor power/skill set combo makes him a no-go for voyages (especially by the time you collect enough stars) and his gauntlet-centric traits are anybody's guess for future collection and event possibilities. Nevertheless, an extremely valuable and exclusive collection spot plus top tier gauntlet prowess ensures that *every* roster will benefit from a copy.
