Timelines takes a Quantum Leap into Jonathan Archer’s future with this Original showing us the great UFP leader he would become. And in terms of game play, “great” is quite the understatement.

Debuting with a BigBase™ and even bigger collar, Prez Archer will DIP in and out of a myriad of events when he’s not pulling daily shuttle duty, even if his bevy of traits and respectable variant history aren’t earning you a Bonus that week. If that doesn’t do it for you, he’ll be busy enough on Voyages thanks to his trifecta of Skill Order, Raw Power, and Traits.

What’s that, dear player? You want more? Ok, how about 3 Stat-Boosting Collections (4 total) and a fair shot at up to 4 more? Still unsatisfied? Let’s throw in a +11 Attack Boost (only Frantic McCoy can do better) that refreshes faster than any of his peers. He pretty much has it all. Well, except Gauntlet use. And his Flavour Text is pretty vanilla. He’s got most of it, damnit!

BigBook Log, Supplemental:
Sadly the days of character audio are long gone, but if he did have a sound byte, I bet it would go something like this: “Leaping about in Timelines, I've found that there are some things in life that I can't change, and there are some things that I can. To get from there to here, to have faith of the heart, to make the right choice. I guess that's what life's about.”
