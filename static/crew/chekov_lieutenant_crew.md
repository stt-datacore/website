Another year, another bland Pavel to Chekoff the list. Not quite Walter Koenig's worst crime against fashion (we're still waiting on Search for Spock pink romper suit Chekov), this tan Tactician's trait set is as inoffensive and unexciting as his skill set, a dash of SCI the equivalent of a bit of dill weed on particularly boring eggs. Fittingly, he can't even lay claim to being the #1 Chekov base for any skill, possessing less security than unarmed Dancing and less command than waporising First Officer.

Without any collections, he'll be headed straight to the freezer once you're done equipping him, to be thawed once or twice a year, depending on how the powers that be are feeling about the original 'someone's got to be the ensign' Trek archetype.
