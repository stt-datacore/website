Senator Vreenak is hovering over this guy's shoulder, but C.O.P. Founder is as Picard as all the rest. Because of that fact and his two 1k bases, he's a great shuttle pilot for daily and event work. Although you're not going to want to drop any honor on a crew this nondescript, Founder's Inspiring collection isn't the easiest to complete and his strong bases and second exclusive collection may make him an attractive option to help finish it.
