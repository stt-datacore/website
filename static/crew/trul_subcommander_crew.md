A slightly overrated crew, which is hard to do because she's quite good. Well known for her big ENG base and double collections draw the eye as well. But with only a single event outside of the Romulan mega, we want our crew winning victory points, not XP trainers. Still, she'll likely pull some faction event work for younger rosters and her skill set will get her on a few voyages, even if the overall numbers are poor.
