Riker had a bountiful event year in 2019, but even with his overdue vanity collection, and with dreary bases aside, AoS is flying at half mast without a handful of stars. An overstuffed skill set undercuts a formerly great voyage ranking that has fallen to merely average. Riker's steady event tally in combination with a handful of intriguing traits should give his modest bases relevance into the future, but he's gone from behold target to consolation prize.
