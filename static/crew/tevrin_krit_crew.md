Tevrin Crit's cheeky arena ability aside, there's not a ton to love about the game's first Tellarite. As with most crew in 'the collection era', we look to traits for relevance. While only Pilot has amounted to anything as of his debut, his relevant trait trio have as good a chance as any to hit on future collections or event bonuses down the line. If it's the latter, ample SEC seating on shuttle should make him a worthwhile thaw candidate.
