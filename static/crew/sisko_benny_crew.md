The Bombastic Benny doesn't quite live up to his fantastic on-screen affair any longer, mostly due to age. His gauntlet pair is respectable at a glance, but it's stuck between a rock and a hard place. Two even proficiency rolls won't win many 1-for-2 matchups and the names above him are all well-known and highly sought after, including Locutus who can smash him with one armature tied behind his back. He's a back end, crit-dependent option.

His collection value is middling at best and both his voyage power and skill set are shy-away for anyone playing for any length of time.

The last bit of bad news comes from the trait department, which are mostly either too common or esoteric to be likely event candidates down the line. Thankfully his SCI base faces little competition for variant events which have included at least one Faction in each calendar year. Between sporadic event chances and early game gauntlet work, Benny is a justifiable behold choice in some cases who may have chances to help you, but is hamstrung by weaker power.
