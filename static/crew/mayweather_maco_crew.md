CMD/DIP/SUCK…bad bases…Travis Mayweather! Easy pass, right? Folks may not want to hear it (and I may not want to type it), but as far as a new account’s first retrieval goes, TACO Mayweather is closer to longtime first round draft picks like Fury Kes or Gary Seven than he is tier 10 fodder.

Sure, voyages are a non-starter and Travis is prone to dud event years, but in the two areas most competitive for new players and where a single crew can make a big difference - gauntlet and arena - he does pretty well.

Arena especially sees him rubbing shoulders with other automatic names like Captain Killy, but he dodges their unfortunately evasion handicap, making him a fine 1B option to the most offensively focused crew available.

His gauntlet bona fides aren’t quite as superlative, but for only a single star he will stack ‘gauntlet boon’ on top of ‘arena boom’. A trio of 45% trait sets and reasonable overall proficiency should overcome a competitive skill set in most cases for players in the early-to-mid game and make it easy to avoid sinking additional honor or behold capital into that area while you wait for Balok to come along.

TACO won’t command a ton of usage on fleshed out rosters, but there’s no shame in seeking him out if you’re a new player. What he offers should make a much bigger impact for you than a crew with a singular focus in shuttles or voyages.
