Would it surprise you to learn that this is the first Uhura variant to have a skill other than Command, Diplomacy or Security? I must say, Captain, it surprised the hell out of me. At least they picked an appropriate time to break that glass - and while we can nitpick at the somewhat copy paste nature of the artwork (check out Nyota Uhura to see what we mean), there can be no more fitting tribute to a pioneer like Nichelle Nichols, someone who helped a world full of young women and people of colour realize their true potential and the things they could become, than an absolute titan of a card like this.

Coming out swinging with a collection profile that makes even some particularly traity Spocks look like chumps, Uhura still has the raw voyage score to overpower a very mundane skill set, and for those of you who missed out on other weekly CMD/DIP/SCI, she’s a more than adequate alternative. Even considering this card’s age, Uhura’s liable to age well, especially since she isn’t bereft of ancillary benefits - her rolls are good enough to grab a few lower level Gauntlet sets, and her ship ability, while tied to the anchor of Boarding damage, still has enough punch to be useable in absence of the more popular Killy and co.

Giveaways like this are a godsend for newer and ‘elderly’ players alike - this is the kind of keystone card you can form a crew roster around, and while the skill set is continually being refreshed, she’s just plain good enough to hang with the boys. If you have a spare citation laying around after the next Honor Sale, she’s well worth the final star, especially if you want to do your bit in paying tribute to a true icon, and that answer is likely to stay the same for a long time. Now, say it with me - to absent friends . . .
