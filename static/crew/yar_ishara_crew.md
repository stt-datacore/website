Coming in with hair that would make Master Shredder jealous and a catsuit that puts Seven of Nine on notice, Sarah Con-Yar is a victim of bad timing for her skill set. The raw numbers are good, including the #2 'SEC and ENG' shuttle seat, but she comes hot on the heels over several other great SEC/ENG crew that effectively equal her voyage score, but bring more to the table for events. As one-offs go, you could do a lot worse, but in the end, she will probably only break your heart.
