The herald of the Delphic Expanse collection, Tarquin's +1 Vanity may be one of the more notable things about him, given that the Xindi have only netted 1 events since the inception of Timelines. A top 25 DIP base is always nice for shuttle work, but we generally like our non-event crew to contribute more in the long term, especially if they happen to be pack only. His +15000 Crit Bonus ship ability is nice, but teamed to EV, it's not optimal in the current ship meta.
