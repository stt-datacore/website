Geordi probably went a little too far with his home theater system (featuring Bose™ surround sound), but at least he doesn't have to get up for bathroom breaks.

It's rare to see crew without a collection these days (though that's sure to change by the time you're reading this) but with a few viable traits, an Ardra-esque arena ability, and moderate event and voyage work, he still clocks in as a mid-level crew with options for usability.
