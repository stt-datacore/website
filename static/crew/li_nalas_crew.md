As someone once said, this is what you're hoping for if they add your favorite crew to the game. The odds of Li Nalas being, say, the number one voyager were about as likely as catching a Cardassian Gul unarmed and in his underwear. But Li is looking at a few years of voyage use (even as CMD/DIP/SUCK) for the average roster with usable shuttle metrics and a non-HFS trait set, which is always ripe for collections and events. He sits outside of must-have territory, but firmly in the could-use category.
