Disruptor Beam have been kind with voyage friendly crew in 2019, but B-4's somewhat surprising #6 voyage total and #22 base SCI are, unfortunately, about all that's noticeable about this ponderous cat lover. Some ranked 4* Gauntlet pairs keep the pudding from spoiling, but unimpressive event chances, a mediocre ship ability, no collections and a truly ridiculous number of Android/Lore variants who are going to be just better, this poor soul is going to be frozen and forgotten before you can say Spot as you acquire better, more regularly useful crew. Very useful for early game players, but otherwise forgettable.
