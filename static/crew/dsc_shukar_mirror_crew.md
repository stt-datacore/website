Shukar has an array of traits, most notably Disco, to help elevate average-to-worse bases. More sturdy proficiencies combine for a couple ranked pairs and help form respectable voyage numbers where he picks up a splash of SCI to prevent him from being too easily replaceable. Discovery megas have hugely buoyed his value, but as a voyager he has enough juice to help you out even if those events dry up.
