They say Kyle Riker is as tough as nails. Nails Riker, I like that. Maybe it’ll catch on somewhere. I hear it’s windy in Alaska too…

Anbo-Daddy Riker finally hachidan kiritsus his way into Star Trek Timelines five and a half years after we got the same version of his son. Better late than never? Thankfully while he’s late to the party, he’s not quite showing up with five and a half year old stats! No siree, this Pulaski-tamer has at least one trick up his sleeve courtesy of some (perhaps niche) DIP/SEC Voyage use thanks to his spread of traits. Said traits unfortunately only offer 2 Collections (both Stat-Boosting) for the time being, but one has to imagine there’s a few more coming his way down the line a la Duelist, Tactician, and/or Crafty. And if those traits hit for an Event, his DIP base could get some play on a Shuttle here and there.

Beyond that, well…his suit looks better than it did in The Icarus Factor. And while I want to maybe criticise his crammed-into-that-helmet looking face, it’s actually pretty true to the episode!
