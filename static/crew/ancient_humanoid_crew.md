If mom tells you we have Ancient Humanoid at home and tries to stick you with Changeling Founder, don't listen! Humanoid is a few gauntlet rolls away from the daily use trifecta, but still brings it for base and voyages to keep her in frequent rotation as a strong option.

Dethroning a Picard is big news considering WRG's (Ben's) love affair with him and so Humanoid's debut as the top SCI base in the game (by a small margin) should win her a few fans who notice the former mega recurring crew bumped down the shuttle selection window. Her stats are allocated for such a purpose, also besting Pupcard's secondary and tertiary, elevating Humanoid into 'best SCI shuttler' territory.

Not a one hit wonder, we have some impressive voyage metrics coming from this crew as well. Her top ten overall debut comes pre-loaded with a handful of valuable anti-matter traits that aren't flush with options like HFS. Despite the ordinary skill set, she's still among the best to wear it and should age far better than other mid-level debuts like Humanoid Figure.

Jens' collection floor of two and ceiling of five is about right for your average crew and worth even more attached to a daily use option like this. By the time she might fall out of service for you, she should have collected a few more spots in stat-boosters and cements her as the sort of event name that you save up your chrons and shuttle boosts to obtain.
