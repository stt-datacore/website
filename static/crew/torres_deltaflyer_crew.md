A shame Torres can’t collect points for her snappy uniform. Released as an appetite whetter just a month before the superior Determined Janeway, Torres’ traits can’t compare to her Captain’s comp, yet that’s all she has. Spotty variant events aside, B'Elanna is left with trait triggers to comprise a portfolio that once included voyages and daily shuttle work.

More dire options surely exist, but without standout numbers in any area, she’s unlikely to make many retrieval lists, meaning it will take several low end beholds before she approaches immortalization status for your roster.
