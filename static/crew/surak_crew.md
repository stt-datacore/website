Kids these days are going to see a juicy collection piece and never know what an all-star Surak was on release. A top five voyage and gauntlet option then, he's still held on well thanks to his exceptional debut power. 

Remaining a voyage option despite the poor skill set, Surak's fistful of anti-matter traits meet power that should be viable through 2023 on some rosters. With a healthy portion of stats allocated to proficiencies, he's also a great if not overpowering gauntlet pick.

Twenty-plus elevated crit sets including a trio of 45%ers is plenty of crit to bring to bear in combination with three healthy proficiency rolls. His skill set shoots the gap between Balok's CMD/DIP, Armus' CMD/SCI, and Loco's DIP/SCI, displaying the dominance of none of those exclusives, but offering plus versatility if you're still trying to make inroads in that competitive area of the game.

With a lovely capstone in the form of a collection quartet and a few more viable traits in hand, Surak remains among the best cards in the game and taken for granted due to his former mega status.
