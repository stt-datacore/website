Once upon a time Khan had "events", but even without them, his lush trait trappings have carried launch-day bases to relevance thanks in part to a skill set that's in demand on shuttles. Most of the rest of this card smells very 2016, from his slow arena damage to his bottom barrel voyage power.

Except for collections, where his ceiling is higher than that of most other crew. He may have to luck into some larger trait pools to get there, but the Resourceful collection has at least made that a distinct possibility. Outside of some very early gauntlet work for fresh rosters (seven [!!!] 45% gauntlets), Khan skips over the working man's roster and goes straight to luxury pick for trait prospectors who are working on stacking up collection skill boosts to put the finishing touches on their rosters.
