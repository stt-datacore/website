If wishes were horses when CMD/SEC would be the Grand National. Khan’s use in the overall scheme of things will depend on how much you have invested in existing crew. Assuming no shiny 4-5* CMD crew have whisked you away on a chroniton exhausting adventure then by all means give him your attention. But I’m going to take a wild guess and say you already have better crew by now.
