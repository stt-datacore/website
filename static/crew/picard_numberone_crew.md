Pup-card's numbers aren't quite as eye-popping as on release, but remain excellent. His huge SCI base won't only claim regular shuttle work, it also puts to shame global gift Mambo and campaign freebie Irumodic for variant event work which has been just above average to date and fairly reliable.

His voyage potential ain't too shabby either. The wrinkle here is a common skill set which boasts several high-powered options on voyages already. That's notable for endgame, spreadsheet-crunching voyage purists who are looking at the 12-13 hour voyage range, but not at all a warning. Stacking strength on strength and gobbling up seven anti-matter seats makes him a defensible citation option. Take the power, enjoy the power.

In the running for best mega crew to date and batting 💯 in a handful of areas, don't feel on the back foot if you've come to Picard and I-Chaya post-mega, just behold and enjoy.
