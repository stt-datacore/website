"Best Orion in the game" is a bar so low a fully limbered up Vina couldn't limbo under it, but here we are. Navaar's event count is propped up by the recently-departed Scoundrel mega, so let's call her what she is: a non-event voyager. Her numbers look good enough on paper, but don't be seduced; she is already joined and bested in the ranks by a fistful of Spocks and other cards that have wider use on the weekends and elsewhere. If you wind up with her on your roster, she can certainly have some daily use potential for a while, but it is unlikely to last. Power creep is undefeated.
