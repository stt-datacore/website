A skittish star for collection holes
To call cites free is absurd
His wonderful trait list could be easily dismissed
For those not quite a nerd

ENG seating scant, voyage metrics swirl
Around the toilet and they'll make you hurl
His event count heaves, then his base will grow
And his agent ever-ready for a spin-off show

His traits support, should you e'er require,
Collections both huge and unsung
He ne'er should be around, lest your voyages break down
Then your revival dil is flung

His bases are ample and on the prowl
To fill in some shuttles with Adira Towel
His tally of bonuses have quite accrued
A reputation for a crew with aptitude
