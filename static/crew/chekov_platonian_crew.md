In an alternate universe where Mirror 'David Duchovny' Reed exists and Chekov is mind-slapping Kirk with his own hand, there lives Platonian Cheekoof. He debuts with a contemporary comp; Courier Burnham. While Chekov has never had grand event ambitions, he's been a stop-and-start weekend contributor and profiles superior to Burnham elsewhere.

With only one other serious SEC/SCI name (Dahj) added to the game's voyage options over the last two years, Chekov will slot in as a higher-end component who should be able to punch a bit higher than the raw score for the duration of his stay on your roster.

Though only one of his collections is 'gameplay relevant', Costume Party's size and number of legendary crew needed does the value heavy lifting for both as its constituents are littered with low-power vanity names. Plato Chekov doesn't hit any power notes, but is strong in a few areas, has his fingers in enough pies, and might just be better than all the rest of his variants combined.
