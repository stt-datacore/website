That cute little oil slick from Mario Kart sure has come a long way. Now he's all grown up and a great choice to blue shell any of your opponents who may be bananas about the gauntlet.

A precursor to the outrageously powerful Balok, Red Angel, or post-buff Locutus, Armus is 'merely strong'. Big SCI rolls aren't the hardest thing to find, but Armus combines his with a good CMD secondary and plenty of elevated crit gauntlets to be a 'tier 2' gauntlet choice and mainstay on many rosters.

His only real SCI/CMD competition is the not-100%-retrievable Away Team Number One whom you will never face walls of. And, well, other Armuses. While his supplemental skill pairs (CMD/SEC, SCI/SEC) have plenty of competition, he's generally more flexible than those other options and is a rotational piece at worst.

For anyone considering citations in a collection-chasing effort, that's rarely going to be the best use of your honor. He's not good enough outside of the gauntlet to be worth the citations and fielding a second copy in gauntlet, even in crit-friendly scenarios is iffy. That all being said, he's still a fantastic option for professional coin flipping enthusiasts.
