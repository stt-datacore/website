Youhura's note used to be such a cinch. She's bad and, twice a year, is slightly less bad for two to four days at a time.

But now the collection train is off the rails and crashing through the homes and neighborhoods of everyone you've ever loved. The massive Resourceful collection is a concession that the sky's the limit and so even a formerly unpalatable trait set like Nyota's may land her in a handful of collections before it's all said and done.

If you behold her, it's for that speculative value or so that when they hit, you can say 'I can't believe she was ever tier 10. The Big Book is a fraud!'
