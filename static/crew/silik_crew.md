Event chances shouldn't be taken for granted in the era of the trait mega events and Silik's CMD base would be fine to thaw for event shuttles. But with zero usefulness in other areas of the game, his value floor is so low that he may not even be worth the cost to immortalize for many players. Wait for one of his off beat traits to hit on a collection before you select him from a behold.
