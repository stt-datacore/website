Sadly Mendon has fallen from grace somewhat. His shuttle score is outpaced by most other 3* SCI/ENG crew due to his low bases however he has enough variation with his skill set to afford him use on a voyage or two. Keep him in mind should you be lacking SCI or ENG crew but don't rush him to promotion.
