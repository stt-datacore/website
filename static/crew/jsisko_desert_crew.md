Jake-o's survivalist trait is incredibly generous, but thanks to CollectionMania (Â© World Wrestling Entertainment), he parlays that trait into a bit of value with the possibility for more, if you want to read pretty far into his release on the heels of his Desert Dad.

Past megas heavily inflate the event count of a bit player who hangs out in the Wesley-Mayweather range for bonuses, but those weekends may be your only chance to use a crew who doesn't boast any voyage or gauntlet utility. If the opportunity cost to aquire thisko Sisko is anything above peanuts, don't feel bad for skipping him.
