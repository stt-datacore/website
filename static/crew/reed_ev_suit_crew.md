No, he doesn’t have a mine poking through his leg, but he’s still a hero. At least insofar as saving Travis counts as heroism. With voyage numbers not favored by global boosts as of this writing, we won’t go so far to say that Reed is a diamond in the rough, but he should do fine on her majesty’s voyage service for a few years post-debut.

Reed gets no love from WRG on the weekend (more like indifference) as evidenced by his Tuesday pack release, but with a smattering of traits and healthy bases, you may be pleasantly surprised by his occasional opportunity at bonus work. Throw in some above average collection value and Reed is a Jack of most trades and a plenty serviceable option for long-suffering Reed fans.
