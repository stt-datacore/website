8472's offerings are at odds. His first star holds the bulk of his value, stars 2-4 are essentially useless, and his last star unlocks the only other thing you should want him for; collections. While it's possible we see his collection count added to alongside an introductory mega, shuttles really shouldn't be much of a consideration when beholding this crew.

His highs are high, but he sports too many handicaps outside of his proficiencies to be worth a five star investment until we see that collection count grow.
