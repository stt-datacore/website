Brain and Brain! What is brain‽

The card that launched many players’ (and WRG’s) love affair with Jadzia in game was lucky to snag a handful of traits before anyone knew what valuable tools they were going to be in the future. Her lack of overall power is apparent and she’s not a crew who should hang out on your active roster, but there’s been consistent weekend bonuses for this variant and her modest collection profile should steadily grow. Not a bad proposition for those looking to throw darts in low-end beholds.
