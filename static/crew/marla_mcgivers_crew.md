A 900 DIP base with fairly uncommon ENG secondary and reasonable arena evasion. Her two events were standalone features and may open up chances for re-run bonuses to power up her already great DIP. But most of her traits are not particularly eventable outside of romantic and her performance to date has mostly been as a daily shuttle pilot which is about as valueless as it gets.
