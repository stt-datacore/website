Young Khan, get outta my mind and take that song with you. Dreamy mid-century Montalban is a hell of a vintage and you’ll certainly want to scoop up this version for his event potential and collection spot. An event count which is modest at a glance is overripe with trait mega possibilities and should have him making the thaw list several times with two usable-when-bonus bases.
