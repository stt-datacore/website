While we were running around wearing masks and getting vaccination certificates, 2021 unleashed another more insidious plague; four Wesley events. He nearly doubled his variant event tally in a single year and does have a few traits that will likely provide future chances for him to flex his awful bases on weekend shuttles.

Usable shipboard evasion exists for superfans, but thatâ€™s where the good news ends until we get a prodigy or [whatever trait] collection down the line. If you want to get an A, pass on Wes.
