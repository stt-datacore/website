An option in the arena little leagues, Paris has a hefty chunk of instant damage whose position trigger can be met by the oft-seen Borg Sphere. Unfortunately that low-yield area might be his best chance at daily contribution as weak voyage numbers relegate him to event horse. Which is really not the worst job out there and has to at least be better than scrubbing the plasma manifolds.

Double digit events (and Factions) for Paris is good news, but even better are the ten (!!) Big Bonus event features split between his other super rare variants. Not a Data-esque situation, Paris isn't swamped in ENG options, making Takeover worth the hundred merits to wrangle another shuttle pilot out of cryo a few times per year. Speaking of cryo, late game players will need to cough up a handful of Maquis and Section 31 items in exchange for a notch on the biggest stat-boosting collection out there in the Costume Party.
