Only the penitent man will pass, so kneeling Trip has a leg up on the competition because he's an old film buff. However at the rate this game has been handing out golds lately, even early gamers may not see much of a use case for two-skill blue cards. Add in the fact that he can't work weekends, and you're basically looking at shuttle filler with a nice +1 to the jury rigger collection. He'd be a nice card to collect when he's the monthly giveaway, but he's not likely to see much daily use.
