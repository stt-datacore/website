Meet the woman responsible for single-handedly annihilating the Diplomacy skill. Before her appearance, the gaps between #1 and the base ranks below were 6, 9, 6, 4, and 2. Her lead over then-#1 Odo is 238. Her DIP base at one star tops dozens of fully fused crew like Smitten or Mambo Picard. It's extremely rare for a crew to dominate the stat ranks like that and if she were Professors Data, Dax, or Burnham, then she would be among the most valuable crew in the game.

Luckily for those who don't have her, Sato is not a bonus-laden card. She will perform in many events with or without a bonus regardless, but not force out all other options as sometimes happens in, say, the gauntlet. Despite being something of a one trick pony, Sato is a singular crew and will easily stand out on your roster, even if the value of what she excels at is up for debate.
