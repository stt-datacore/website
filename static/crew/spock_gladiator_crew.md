The renaissance man is at it again, this time putting Gangster's peashooter to shame. Double digit traits have created double, double digit event chances and give him excellent utility for both voyage antimatter and future event bonuses. His base SEC is leagues ahead of the next best Spock option who happens to be someone players rarely immortalize; one-star wonder Gangster Spock. He can handle his variants' competition with a single star and in many cases will be the easy choice over super rares to win your favor for shuttle seating. In combination with prodigious weekend work, his gun (sword, I guess) will be called upon fairly frequently.

Gladiator has dropped off certain voyage-only citation lists because of the raw ranks, but with only two SEC/SCI names above him in overall power there, his voyage ability is still a great side dish to his other offerings. Piddly proficiency numbers and middling arena work are available for the glass-half-empty crowd to critique, but his owners will be too busy using him regularly to care.
