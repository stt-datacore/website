I’ll take “Decent Non-Event Crew” for $800, Alex. Obrist may be champion of Quiz Bowl, but once his Mega-moment passed, so did a lot of his value to veteran players. Boasting mostly OK voyage power and a few niche traits, Obrist offers nothing you can't find elsewhere, but would help out early rosters if you can collection multiple stars in short order.
