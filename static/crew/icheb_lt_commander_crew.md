Itchy's surface-level numbers are not particularly noteworthy for a 2020 crew (which still leaves him above average overall), but he ranks well for his voyage skill set and has some volatile trait value; most notably Borg, which isn't overflowing with SCI options.

Strong arena evasion is another blip of value if you take Icheb to max for his time-travel-done-right episode or if you're anticipating a killer bridge crew photo alongside Adult Wesley in the future.
