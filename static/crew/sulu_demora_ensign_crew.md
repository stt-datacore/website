Sulu supplied her sole sweet spot in the pilot mega that closed out 2018 and with a list of crowded and uneventable traits, that may be her last chance to help you outside of a Pilot/SEC node unlock in the Celestial Temple distress call. The least likely of her three non-HFS traits did find her some collection value and though the others may follow, her ceiling is limited.
