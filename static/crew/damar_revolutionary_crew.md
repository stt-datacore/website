After years of playing the longsuffering straight man, season 7 badass Damar is here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, but he's all out of both. It's a shame to reduce such a heroic on-screen character to 'Budget Kahless', but seeing as the venerable clone is ahead of Damar in all three of his ranked gauntlet pairs, it's a true statement. With a Cardassian mega his likeliest path to non-gauntlet relevance, it's best to take one star of Damar as a gauntlet stopgap while you upgrade other parts of your roster.
