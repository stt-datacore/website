Hailing from a personal favorite episode that saw Mr. Atoz push the Pram-a-lot, Zarabeth’s art holds up its end of the bargain, but the raw stats don’t. A quick glance will let you know that outside of some early game stopgap arena evasion, there’s really nothing here outside of what traits can provide.

That being said, Zarabeth has a healthy collection profile and has mustered a respectable event history during the trait mega era and looks to continue that going forward. She’s merely a bit player and not a wagon to hitch your early game roster to, but still a behold option that established players should be happy to welcome aboard.
