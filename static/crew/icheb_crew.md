Borg events stop and start more than a rusted, red '36 Ford, but ST:Picard has at least a chance to bring them around again on weekends where Icheb may find work as a bit player shuttle pilot. His lede should be double stat-boosting collections, but with a relatively pricey build, you might opt to level him after other daily-useful crew.
