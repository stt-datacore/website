If you were in the Big Book lounge during this crew's release, you may have heard muttered a few, "Fuck if I know"s, and boy were they earned. Bones only has one skill, but it's bloody enormous. Aside from Culber's 'MED and SCI' shuttle score, McCoy posts #1s across the board for his "And" shuttle seat ranks which read 1/1/1/1/2. For perspective, base(d) God Professor Sato's "And" ranks are 1/1/3/4/4 and she even has the luxury of two extra skills!

He's *going* to be used, the only question is how often? With MED bringing up the Faction rear accounting for roughly 9% of event seating, there are weekends where you won't see a single MED seat across any of the 3-seat missions and only sprinkled in sparingly elsewhere. Yet with only three super rares able to match him with a bonus, Bones often only needs one opportunity to be the best choice.

The value of a naked shuttle score is among the most variable attributes to try and rank. If you run tanked shuttles or max difficulty missions, if you love Faction events or eschew them in favor of other types... Bones is far from Captain Scott territory, but you should try him out for yourself to see how often he's making a difference for you and to what degree.
