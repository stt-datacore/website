From 1/5 to 5/5, Gun Show Picard is exceptional. He comes with a free 100k honor for those who choke on Kahless' price tag and collects gauntlet criticals like it's his job. He remains one of the better CMD/SEC voyagers and his abundance of trait + Picard events make middling bases far more useful. Don't let it get you down that others may have gotten him for free from his mega event or campaign. This is one time you don't want to zig while others zagged, just take him.
