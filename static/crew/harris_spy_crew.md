Super rares with a handful of event features are usually worth snagging at some point, even if they were featured alongside the likes of Anij and the Grand Nagus. But without any real daily use value, the only consistency you'll get from Harris is his spot in the massive Resourceful collection.

One or two traits may pop up for future events, particularly Section 31, but his non-Resourceful value is entirely speculative.
