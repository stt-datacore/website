Who’s the most useful MED card for new players, is it one of the career Starfleet doctors? Nope it’s Kes. Whilst she’s not the strongest 2* MED (her max is only 18 points away from Phlox) she is the most useful. Her Ocampan trait is needed for some cadet missions which means she is essential for all players in the game. I want to rate her lower based on her ship ability and the fact that it...is...Kes, but alas she’s too darned useful.
