Trip could grow into a fine collection piece at some point, but doesn’t offer much day to day and lacks broader cadet eligibility to be worth your precious trainers in the early game. Feel free to airlock copies as they come in unless you’re on the precipice of a collection milestone and have the chrons to spare.
