It's rare that a Legendary card has arguably less long term benefits than a Super Rare equivalent, but comparing the Captain of the T'Kumbra with the Captain of the Logician baseball team (seriously, how did Solok talk his crew into that?), you end up feeling like he comes up short. Sure, he'll add to your Vulcan collection, but he lacks the fun vanity of his super rare variant, his voyage power is a snore, and until the Writer mega that gives us all four more copies of Quinn, his event history reads Vulcan, Vulcan, Vulcan.

Solok might squeeze into a voyage or shuttle here or there, but isn’t a recommended investment from star one and lacks a lot of the depth that gives other crew enduring value.
