A single Reed event in the three year stretch prior to this note is more embarrassing than finding out someone likes pineapple. And the laughably low SEC base for a security officer that got duped by his penis is certainly thematic, but doesnâ€™t much help his poor overall power level.

As with most crew of a certain age, Reed is a string of collection traits and, when WRG is feeling generous, a variant event or two. Despite poor bases, CMD and DIP seating is plentiful and he may merit the thaw for certain rosters, but this is more of a bland, perfunctory crew to build passively from voyage returns and otherwise bad beholds.
