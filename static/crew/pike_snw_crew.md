A CMD/DIP/SUCK giveaway who’s boring as sin, but with the power to inspire guilt if you skip that last star. Stop me if you’ve heard this number before.

A Trait and Skill set clone of the equally mustard Christopher Pike, at least this version is souped up in the daily use department. The similarities, however, also mean that this crew can’t be isolated to a 100% chance in Crew Retrieval. So while his long term outlook may be unbuttered Matzo, if you want to enjoy his power in the short term, consider him an elevated Legendary Behold priority.

Only a trio of viable Traits limits his ceiling for Collections and associated bonus Events, but Pike is a Captain and gets those variant Events to go with it.
