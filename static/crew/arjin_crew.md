Look at that face. Isn’t that the face of a hero? For those of you who remember this thoroughly middle of the road episode of DS9, you probably either dislike or thoroughly loathe this piece of wet toast, and this card doesn’t do him any favours. SCI/CMD/DIP is the new CMD/DIP/SEC, and with his traits exhausted (Civilian or Trill mega seems unlikely), the most Arjin can offer you is merely okay voyage use on a fledgling roster, and a +9 Accuracy boost in the Arena. Freeze and forget.
