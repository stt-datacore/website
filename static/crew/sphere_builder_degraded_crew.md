Does the Degraded Sphere-Builder check the boxes for a new Super Rare crew in 2023?  Let’s see!

Box 1 is Collections. Three out of the box, as of the writing of this note missing an obligatory Delphic Expanse vanity Collection, but WRG has previously mentioned they have to manually add those crew, so we can look for this crew to end up there in a few months or weeks, who knows.  A sub-box to Box 1 is Traits, and we can see Prisoner and Scoundrel right in the sweet spot for future Collections. Heck, we’ve gotten a Prisoner Mixed Behold and a Scoundrel Mega Event, so that tells you all you need to know!  Could be at six Collections by the end!

Box 2 is the other stuff. Top 40 voyager on release, only relevant for new players and Nightmare mode doofuses. They’re not a Gauntlet crew, and they won’t do much on Ships with a Position Trigger Accuracy boost. It’s possible their big ENG base might do some good on a deep deep Faction Event roster when one of their traits is a bonus, but that’s a pretty niche usage.

The Verdict? Checks the boxes, so get 4 copies, Fully Equip, and Finish, Freeze, and Freakin’ Forget™.
