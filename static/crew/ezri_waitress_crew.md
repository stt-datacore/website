Ezri is a textbook new player stepping stone crew. The young roster highlights, triggerless arena damage and medium proficiencies with a handful of 45% gauntlets, are availble at one star making her an easy behold choice if you're just starting out. Unfortunately the other three stars don't measure up in value. Dax does boast plenty of events and many rosters are looking to cobble voyage MED together from any source, but with 2016 stats, the window for use in those areas is short-lived.

Considering the overall package and obligatory immotalization for the expansive Costume Party collection, Ezri exceeds the sum of her parts and is just waiting for that Bada Bang vanity collection to be fully joined.
