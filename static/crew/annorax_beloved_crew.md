Stop smiling at me like that, you're creeping me out. New and improved Happy Annorax outdoes standard issue Annorax statistically, but that doesn't do much to help him escape his fate as a non-Event Stat dud with little else to speak of other than a pair of Collections with perhaps two more untapped Traits for later.
