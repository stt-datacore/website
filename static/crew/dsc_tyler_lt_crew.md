Rocket fueled by eight (!!!) previous megas, Tyler has accrued an unbelievable event tally. With a healthy number of viable traits, his collection and event opportunities should hold strong for some time. Beyond the clumps of Tyler/trait events, he’s also one of only a few crew to offer the Pilot/SEC node unlock, even if that’s the only thing you use him for before his trip to cryostasis.
