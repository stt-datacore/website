Captain Brötchen debuted as a Time Portal Giveaway/Endurance Objective Event Legendary, so if you’re coming across him fresh, be sure to look at him with fresh eyes as opposed to those of your elderly player Fleetmates who got him 4/5 back in 2022.

Solkar doesn’t offer many niche attributes such as Ship Ability prowess or some nifty Crit Gauntlets, but although he lacks vaunted main cast status, Solkar’s Trait list has caught WRG’s eye many times before and he should continue snagging a Faction Event or two per year.

The tantalizer looking to earn your favor is a strong set of Collections, which debuted at four and may reach its ceiling of six before it’s all said and done. A fine Legendary Behold option or Crew Retrieval choice, he’s lacking in daily use but has enduring value for almost any roster.
