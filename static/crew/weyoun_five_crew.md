Aptly named, Weyoun Clone is a clone of the ranked reward that came just a few weeks earlier; Musketeer Picard. Sadly, his event number isn't called nearly as often and his daily offerings are several shades south of solid. Double stat-boosting collections are certainly a consideration, but unless you're on the precipice of finishing both, you're better off looking for a crew who excels at something, rather than being average in all corners as Weyoun is.
