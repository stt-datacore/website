Unlikely to contribute on weekdays, Duelist is more of a luxury event pick with strong collections shared by most Torres variants. Neither of her bases are impressive and she may not even make event shuttles before four stars, but she also has a handful of possible one-off event traits and the Torres event cushion. There's theoretical gauntlet value for a pair rated at 83% of maximum with three 45% gauntlet sets, however she sports two merely average rolls and will need both skills to line up, meaning she often performs better on paper than in game.
