Like Lower Decks or not, it’s clear the developers of this game enjoy the show and include fun variants of the crew into the game wherever possible, with the art to go along with it. Deep Space Niner Mariner (notedly Mariner in late-season DS9 uniform with a lovely frock of hair) holds a cocktail and the key to this writer’s heart.

WRG’s Warp 9.975 Power Creep™️ continues apace even with Super Rares, so Mariner debuts in the top 10 for Voyagers, but with a middling skill set of DIP/SCI/SEC. Personally, this writer is a fan of SCI/SEC in any permutation, and so that combination along with six voyage antimatter traits (for all of which she is among the top options) means if you are still using Super Rares, she will likely find seating.

Outside of the standard Human/Federation/Starfleet, Mariner has 3 more viable collection traits and is already included in the obligatory “show collection” of Animated. With her big ol’ DIP base, she’ll find work on Mariner event weekends. No Gauntlet or Ship Battle use, but Mariner still has her charms.
