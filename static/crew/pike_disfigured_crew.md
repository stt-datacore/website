Beep Beep...okay we’ll leave that joke alone. Pike isn’t really a crew you want to make a project of early on in Timelines. He lacks weekend cadet mission eligibility and has a fairly limited number of trait node unlocks, most of which have a wide pool of candidates. Swing back around later on for his (limited) collection value, but feel free to airlock him for space as needed.
