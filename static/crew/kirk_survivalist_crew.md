True to his on-screen performance, this Kirk has cobbled together every useful part of a card and created a cannon of a crew. Collections? Check. Useful gauntlet work, strong ship ability, a billion events? Check, check, check.

Kirk has fallen from the voyage ranks, but most of his scorecard is as yellow as the sulphur he's packing. His gauntlet ability is a tale of two rosters. Endgame players are going to see him squeezed out by parades of Red Angel and Caretaker, but a massive number of elevated crit gauntlets make him one of the better retrievable options to help new players make inroads in that competitive area of the game.

Young rosters will also appreciate his triggerless shipboard damage, available from star one. Those attributes can help him earn his keep during the fusion process and when maxed, a few more systems come into play; his fistful of collections and tons of events. Kirk has been the best event name in the game for years and with only his survivalist trait providing much help for this variant so far, he's one of the few crew whose big event tally doesn't feel artificially inflated.

There's no single elite stat for Butter Kirk to hang his hat on, but the broad utility is there in spades and makes a case for him as one of your first retrievals if you're new to the game.
