A "use" crew, rather than an investment. The #1 SEC proficiency gives her gauntlet work right from 1/4 and strong SEC voyage numbers with a splash of SEC/SCI can help push your roster into the mid-game. Usable +Att at 6 seconds in the arena. And the "Disco. So hot right now. Disco." invisi-trait might pluck her from the freezer in the future, though more storied rosters might find her bases unpalatable now that Disco crew are so plentiful.
