Your federally mandated CDS gruel-slop is here, honey! Oooh, and it comes bundled with a free Tom Paris commemorative plate! What’s this note here . . . ‘Dear recipient, we here at VOY Voyeurs pride ourselves on flavourful artwork paired to utterly run-of-the-mill skill sets - like a Bollinger aftertaste to a glass of Budweiser, we’ll leave you confused, momentarily satisfied, and then wondering if citing us up was really a good long term investment!’ 

About the only real edge that this Paris has over a million other CDS variants is some non-standard traits like Hero, Cultural Figure and Inspiring, which will leverage into collection value and potential event work beyond Paris’ already good portfolio - indeed, Paris’ good Faction record means his impressive CMD base will go far. If you struggle to fill his voyage traits on the regular (there are only so many truly good Pilot voyagers), then there could be lasting worth there, too, but let’s be real, this is not a card that you should be looking to fill a statistical void in your life.
