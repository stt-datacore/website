An arena attack boost at four seconds never gets a mention thanks to its accuracy handicap, leaving a strong SEC base as her sole talking point. Andorian is the eye-catching trait, accounting for five of her events, but she has a couple others which are in the bonus pool size range for off-the-wall mega events, even if they don’t appear eventable at a glance. If the Plakson faithful want her, you’re taking Tarah on the back of a gun and a prayer for a future mega to justify thawing her.
