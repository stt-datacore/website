Itchy's events stop and start more than a rusted, red '36 Ford as he lives from mega to mega, but his traits have done a good job providing him chances at some shuttle piloting along with multiple collections. With a relatively pricey build, you might opt to level him after other daily-useful crew, but he's a fine low end pickup from beholds.
