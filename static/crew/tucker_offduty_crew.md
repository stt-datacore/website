Only the penitent man will pass, so kneeling Trip has a leg up on the competition because he's an old film buff. However at the rate this game hands out higher rarity options, even early gamers may not see much of a use case for two-skill blue cards. Add in the fact that he can't work weekends, and you're basically looking at shuttle stuffer and collection fodder.
