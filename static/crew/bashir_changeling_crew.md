His lede is usually the ENG/MED combo, but of all qualifying crew, his voyage ENG+MED stat total is the lowest. So why is he rated this highly? The skill set is simply rare enough (including SEC/MED) that he outperforms the raw voyage stats. In addition, Bashir, Augment, Physician, Changeling, and Dominion events have him popping up on your Faction shuttles regularly, and he pitches in a collection once immmortalized.
