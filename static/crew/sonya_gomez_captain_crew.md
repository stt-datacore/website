You know how Captain Picard once said, 'tis better to have loved than lost? There's a similar saying when it comes to fan favourite characters like Sonya Gomez that goes, 'tis better to have been ignored than had a sub-par gold made out of you, and sadly, that's pretty much the case for Gomez. Debuting at exactly the right voyage rank to be borderline obsolete, especially if you obtained SNW's Una from an event earlier this year, WRG even threw her an ENG tertiary that was probably meant to make her seem a bit more flavourful, but only served to invite unflattering comparisons.

Bringing exactly zilch to your Gauntlet, your ship battles or your event portfolio (unless you're really banging down the door for a 4* Spilled Hot Chocolate on Picard's Crotch variant), her only real value comes from some generous and slightly cookie cutter collections, which you should do your best to enjoy because it's unlikely, or nearer impossible, that she's going to bag any more. In terms of lasting value, she's fine as a shuttle mule if you were . . . somehow, lacking, in CMD/DIP (really, amongst all these giveaways and mega crew?), but frankly, Gomez is easily frozen and forgotten for those of us without the slots to keep crew around pretty much solely because we like them. A shame, really, for a character who went from a two-off episode experiment to Captain of the USS Archimedes thanks to some warm hearted Lower Decks writing - if only WRG had as much love in their hearts for Sonya as we do.
