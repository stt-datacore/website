Promoted to Lt. Commander, Detmer's Timelines representation has kicked it up a notch as well with this potentially Voyage-ready variant who should be able to find some use when the Antimatter Seating is right. Unfortunately, while this is a skillset that until earlier in 2022 boasted a somewhat elderly Admiral Forrest and long-time stalwart Borg Queen as its go to crew, Detmer drops at a time when characters such as recent event reward President T’Rina (and Insubordinate Mariner, if you swap the DIP and CMD around) have come to the forefront. First Officer Una (if you have her) may pip Keyla for seating in all of her relevant traits, but those same traits are varied enough that you'll appreciate that they bring with them a few Stat-Boosting Collections and the potential for a couple more down the line. Until then she will just have to “pop” on your roster thanks to her snazzy 32nd Century Ops uniform and sleek new cranial implant.
