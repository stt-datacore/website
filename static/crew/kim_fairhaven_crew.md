If you're looking for positives outside of that dapper outfit, both of Cow Kissin’ Kim's bases are variant-best - an amazing feat for a Super Rare, though that speaks less to his quality and more to how horrid most Harry variants are. Still, we won’t look a gift cow in the mouth, considering his lack of pizzazz elsewhere.
