Rather more useful than you’d expect, with a tertiary SCI, Admirable gauntlet pairs, and a strong voyage score. Unlikely to pick up many events with the Pilot mega behind us, but the weekend isn’t everything. Daily contributions are going to be your bread and butter for the early game, and Tom’s disapproving dad is nothing if not capable of pitching in.
