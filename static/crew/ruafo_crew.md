F. Murray Abraham's hateable perS'ona (still) owns the top ENG base in the game, but contributes next to nothing in the arena, gauntlet, or collections tab. He's below average on voyages, even considering a plus skill set. A handful of traits give him some wiggle room on possible future weekend bonuses, though in all likelihood, he'll be holding down a Faction seat for events with thin bonus pools. That's still a useful job, but on any given week he'll be competing with over a hundred crew who will be a better choice for those uncommon ENG slots when bonus.

All this is not to say that Ru'afo is a bad card. Just be aware that the stories you hear about him will come from players who obtained him fully fused out of the box from his mega event. If you have The Traveler on your roster and are happy with the investment, that's the sort of future trajectory you can expect from Ru'afo.
