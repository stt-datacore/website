Aaaaaaand they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming - little known fact, Smash Mouth's 1999 hit was actually written by Greg Camp in a precognitive fugue state where he predicted WRG's production of top ten voyage crew in Q2/3 of 2022. A strange choice for their second album, but hey, it seems to have aged well - as will Arex, the true voyage all-star. Even with WRG's printing presses stuck on ULTRA-TURBO-MEGA-HYPEBEAST, Arex is going to last you for the rest of the game on voyages, and comes bearing a hat trick of tricky, wide collections with traits to spare. 

He even comes locked and loaded with decent enough proficiencies that you could use him in a pinch in Gauntlet if you feel like flipping all three fingers to your opponent when their 5% Astrophysicist Sulu completely whups you out of nowhere. The esoteric traits and meaty CMD base mean he won't be a complete event non-entity, but this is first and foremost a voyager, so get out there, grab a copy of this Edosian, and make your voyages E-go-go-gosian. Oh, and give Courier Burnham her notice on the way out, would you?
