PRAX!!!

Missed opportunity to make this his Ship Ability quote aside, Kashyk (not to be confused with the Wookiee homeworld from the other Star [blank] franchise) joins the game as the first, best, and worst Devore available, dropping from the Convergence Day Objective Event via Fuse activity.

Each of the crew in the OE have their own unique attributes, and Kashyk is a Voyage crew, through and through, with a splash of Ship Ability utility. Voyages first: while his Skill set includes two thirds of the most overused stack up with DIP/SEC, that combination is at least the most desirable of the possible permutations, and a handy ENG Tertiary leaves him out of the dreaded CDS doldrums. Top ten power on debut gives him staying power, helping to overcome only five Antimatter bonus opportunities. 

An interesting Ship Ability has him getting +15000 to Crit Bonus at 10s, and a Charge option to get all the way to +20000 at 16s. Are you going to play it manually to get the 33% bonus by letting it fill up? Probably not, plus his Accuracy Boost is not ideal for Fleet Boss Battles, putting him well behind Demo Man Scotty, Vox, and T'Pring as Spock in utility. 

A trio of debut Collections plus five more viable Traits gives him immediate and long-term value, so if you’re willing to play the Weekly Events a little and throw some Legendary Citations on him, that’s what you’ll be getting on your Voyages and in your Collections Hub.
