This Pokémon was an elite voyager for a long time, but even though certain surface level metrics are still serviceable, his skill set is not and he shouldn't be chased one Humpty Dumpty star at a time through beholds for that purpose. A new player who may come to him fused from an event can find some use for him there, but more likely as a one-star proposition thanks to plenty of crit power and a big CMD roll in the gauntlet.

Many players have their eye on his collections. Already offering a few as of this writing, his ceiling in this area is higher than most and once that list is fleshed out a little more, he'll be able to pay off his extremely expensive build of 100+ faction items and several super rare components.
