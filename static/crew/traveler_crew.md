Wesley's creepy friend has had a great run of almost two years and while he's not quite dead in the water, several other options have begun crowding him out. After joining the game as the #1 base ENG, he now finds himself dwarfed by former Megas Ru'afo and Janeway and is nearly equalled by recent Mega Etana Jol. That makes a non-event base far less valuable than it would be in a skill without that sort of ubiquitous competition. With his weekend chances contingent on a lucky trait mega and a daily effectiveness that's sinking fast, Traveler's arrow is firmly pointing down.
