T'Pol's ranking here is a rather begrudging one. She has the theoretical tools to be useful on most rosters; top ten CMD/SCI voyage work, useable T'Pol bases if you want to corner the market on the only NX-01 crew to reliably get events, and even a middling gauntlet pair for fresh accounts. In practice, however, she also has to contend with the second most populous skill set behind CMD/DIP/SEC and what has settled down to a single Faction event per year. Without the traits to help perk up otherwise above average numbers, she may end up with more bark than bite on your roster.
