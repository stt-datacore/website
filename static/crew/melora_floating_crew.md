Another of Riker's Angels, our floating angel here can work all the weekday cadet missions and still have enough energy to help out in ship battles. She is useful for clearing lots of mission nodes. No collection but she is absolutely essential for new players. Keep her, cherish her, treat her well and she will do the same for you.
