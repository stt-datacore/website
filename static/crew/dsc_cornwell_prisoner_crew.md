Corny was the prototypical powerhouse MED crew and is, in some respects, still one of the best. The ranks of the MED bases have been shored up over the last year and a few voyagers are now on her level, but not many can offer both in one package like she does. She's one of four MED crew in the 1k/1k base club and only prized fusion Cheesecake Seven has better voyage power among MED primaries. Who knows what the Disco event scene holds in the future, but even if you told me she never snags another bonus, I wouldn't bat an eye at taking her raw power in my behold. +1 Diplomat is a nice bonus for a crew who absolutely deserves to be at 5/5 on your roster.
