"I always knew this day would come." You may have had to walk the 6-pack plank when Picard debuted (You'll never make it...no one ever has), but now that he’s in the portal, is he still worth it?

With a trio of commendations to his name (meritorious collections), you'll be hoisting Picard up the star counts to tap into all three of his offerings on voyages, shuttles, and collections. A DIP base almost two hundred points higher than any other Picard crew makes him a strong option for shuttles, bonus or not.

Picard events didn’t explode in the wake of his namesake show, but he still collects bonuses at the clip you’d expect from a real life icon and some of the same traits that sprinkle in anti-matter value on voyages have popped for weekend event bonuses too. Even as his somewhat poor skill set ages out of voyages, his event work should keep him a relevant name on any roster.
