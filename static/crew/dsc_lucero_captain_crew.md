Thinking Lucero would anchor our Discovery shuttles for years...well, I guess that makes us the idiots. At least almost every other part of this card is good for something. Ardra-lite arena ability, worthwhile voyage metrics (if you can fuse her early), even an admirable event tally post-Disco megas.

Rather than sit on her hands with a dozen untapped traits, Lucero cashed in early and offers us strong collection value right out of the box. Established rosters welcome her aboard for that reason alone, while early-to-mid game players can utilize her other perks safe in knowing that the behold investment will pay off long term as well.
