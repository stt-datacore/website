Even with the prospect of a President mega looming on the horizon, it's hard to see any event work in Honest Abe's future. No matter, his bases wouldn't be worthwhile there anyways. The aged gauntlet option is no longer ranked in the top 15 of any skill pair, but still lets his spear do the talking as a top ten DIP option. His collections are something of a catch 22; it's undeniably valuable and rare to snag two tough collection spots with one crew, but you'd essentially be investing four stars worth of value for them and nothing else. Recommended one star only.
