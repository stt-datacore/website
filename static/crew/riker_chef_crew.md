If you smell what the Chef is cooking, you'd know he's serving up a pretty tasty dish, with just a hint of that "taken from the god-awful Enterprise finale" aroma to add complexity to the bouquet. As the only Riker with MED as well as a hefty DIP base, Chef Riker is the rare main cast card where two of his three skills are variant-best, and while his Trillsome counterpart Odan may have stolen some of his shine, he still has his edge. 

Which, if you had him from his intimidating debut twelve pack(!), you'll have found extremely handy! He popped off for a five event feature in 2019 and should continue to provide plus weekend value thanks to ST:Picard, especially if you found yourself enamoured with his Nepenthe stone baked pizza and are angling to pick up some intriguing potential future variants.

He doesn't stand out elsewhere, lacking Gauntlet prospects and with a punchless ship ability, but his middling Voyage total is uniquely-skilled enough that he will probably find more work there than the raw numbers project. With the long history of underwhelming, underpowered Riker variants before him, it's an easy call to snap up this version when you have the chance.
