Captain Spock would remind us that "Klingons don't have tear ducts", but forum posters do. Stats for the iconic movie Spock came in a hair under impressive and heralded the opening of many new salt mines, but a year and a half later, he still has some usefulness as a mid-level card. 

Go figure, his stats haven't gotten better over time, but he's still teetering on the plus side for voyages with a dash of new player gauntlet utility when he collects a favorable gauntlet crit number from one or more of his many traits. Spock's main contribution continues to be events, also boosted by traits, with perennially strong bonus chances and a pair of usable (but weak) bases.
