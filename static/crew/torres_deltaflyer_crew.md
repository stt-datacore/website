The event rate is likely to slow for this particular Torres variant due to a few previously tapped traits, but with THREE variant-best bases, she can pick her seat to any Torres or Klingon events down the line. More frequently useful to most players is voyage work that compares almost identically to former mega Determined Janeway - someone who might be on your voyage right now. Another year or two of value there plus a spot in the huge Klingon collection makes 'Lanna a fine card to behold, even if she's not a top line citation name.
