Following Discovery megas, Airiam is living trait to trait on the weekends, where her value has taken a big dip. Voyages and gauntlet are out of the question too, leaving a fast-activating arena boost as her only significant avenue for daily contributions and even then, only for a short time.

In the meantime, collections have become the name of the game and her four non-FHS traits could all be called upon at some point. For collection value alone, feel free to star up and freeze hairyarm at your leisure and wait for scattershot event bonuses to spring her from cryo jail.
