Despite a controversial debut argument over Augmented or not, this suitably crafty anti-hero still has a fistful of traits that have kept his value buoyant over time.

Although much of his daily use has dried up in the face of power creep, he'll still collect occasional mega events to merit thawing him for those ubiquitous security shuttle seats. Try saying that ten times fast...
