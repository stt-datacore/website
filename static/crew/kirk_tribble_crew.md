There's no easier comparison for this chicken sandwich enthusiast than the Queen of Timelines herself - First Officer Burnham. In fact, if Burnham were originally a mega crew and not some wriggly "best chance" fishing bait, her numbers might have looked shockingly similar. Kirk is a step down in power, but the make-up of both crews appears pretty similar; sturdy event chances, big CMD base, shipboard instant damage, and even the same skill order. 

Day one voyage ability looks merely O.K. for Kirk, though it's more of a supplementary attribute for long-time players. The skill set and power metrics settle vaguely into the average range for a newer release and his handful of anti-matter traits will often butt up against several other eligible legendary crew. 

More unique are Kirk's offerings in the arena - triggerless and fast instant damage always earns a thumbs up - and on shuttles. Tribble debuts with a top ten CMD base which automatically catapults him ahead of former #1 Kirk option; the *four year old* Gangster Kirk. Having no equal to his massive featured event tally, Kirk-flavored weekends are likely to remain frequent, making Tribble Kirk a mainstay Faction lock for years to come.
