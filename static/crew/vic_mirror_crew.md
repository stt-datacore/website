Vic’s above average mix of base and trait count has been useful in spurts and should continue to be, but leaves him susceptible to huge stretches of irrelevance. Luckily for him, a spot in a post-release stat-boosting collections makes him an attractive behold choice for players who don't need any day to day contributions from their super rares.
