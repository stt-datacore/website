One of the most warm and empathetic ambassadors in Trek history, this Paris card surely deserves such a diplomatic bent… "I'd rather spend a year in solitary confinement than listen to any of this." ... perhaps not.

Regardless, this 'intransigent young man' is a fine pickup for his age. Paris' relatively heavy Faction rate for his Events, favorable Shuttle Skill set, and handful of Traits should all help keep him in the mix for weekend work and justify any Crew Slot pressure if you're building him slowly through Legendary Beholds or Crew Retrieval because of a lack of daily work.

His Skill set, also favorable for Voyages, had won him some leash for his first few years, but as he has fallen out of contention there, it's really only his fast Ship Ability that may appeal in the realm of daily use if you're the kind of player who likes to win with their favorites. A multi-Collection piece who should reach his ceiling of four before WRG runs out of Traits, Krenim Paris can help out from a handful of different angles, even if his power is not top shelf.
