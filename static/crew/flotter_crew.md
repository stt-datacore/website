Trevis and butthead are not the most esteemed names to join the game and their long-term value is uncertain, but there's still value here. Stopgap arena work and a lot of potential packed into tiny trait sets comprise the bulk of the value for Trevis and...that other one. Hologram has had a field day with events and all of their traits are viable for further weekend bonuses or collections.
