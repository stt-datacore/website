His arena reputation precedes him; +9 attack for a healthy duration. It's good that he found a niche, because his stats don't support much else for daily use aside from a blue moon 45% gauntlet.

While traits have kept his event count healthy, Reed himself gets almost zero love from WRG and so even though CMD/SEC are the typically the skills you want for shuttle seating, his bases are poor enough to be skippable for events on certain rosters. With crew retrieval allowing players to bypass him as an arena stepping stone, it's likely that his collection value (including trait potential) is an increasingly large chunk of his overall value going forward.
