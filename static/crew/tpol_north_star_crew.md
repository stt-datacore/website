One of the few ENT crew to get much love from WRG, T'Pol does well for herself in the realm of events. A steady drip feed of variant bonuses interweave with several eligible traits to provide North Star plenty of opportunities to show up to work with a big shuttle score.

On the back nine of her voyage lifespan, the power isn't there to help the very common CMD/DIP/SCI skill set shine, but she's not dead in the water yet and a few off-beat traits like Costumed or Telepath will extend her opportunities there.

NS T'Pol is also one of several crew to benefit from the shift toward collections and her value there has helped offset drooping stat ranks and gives her yet another angle of contribution. With a respectable shipboard evasion ability as well, T'Pol sports underrated utility and something to appeal to just about everyone.
