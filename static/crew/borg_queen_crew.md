The OG mega recurring crew has aged far better than anyone could have guessed and has actually pulled off the transformation from voyager and part time gauntleteer to event and collection horse.

Queen's half dozen voyage anti-matter traits and uncommon skill set bore fruit for over four years, but she's slipping from service on many rosters. Nevertheless, that excellent trait set has given her incredible versatility elsewhere.

Her half dozen 45%+ gauntlet sets were more potent when there were fewer CMD options available and so they're more of an early game curiosity these day. More impressive is an event portfolio that surpasses many crew with steady variant features. There's no reason to believe that her trait list which encompasses groups both big and small is "used up" or in danger of going cold.

Long time players may have taken for granted the growth in Queen's collection value, but she's more than just the Collective at this point. With strong collections and a high likelihood of that count growing, she's still a contributor to any roster even when her daily use dries up completely.
