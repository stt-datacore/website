Leila's superb art may have us on our knees, but her numbers may not ease our worried minds (or precious crew slots) for long.

A splash of MED never hurt a crew and certainly bolsters what could have ended up as a much worse skill set. Not a recommended voyage investment starting from star one, it’s nevertheless Leila’s highlight when it comes to usability.

Her overall stats paint a picture of a crew that may just barely find work were you to fuse her up immediately, but the card is still littered with red flags. As we have seen time and time again, crew lacking raw statistical power tend to have a shorter shelf life when they don't have Event, Arena, or Gauntlet usage to fall back on and unfortunately Leila comes up short in all three areas.

Her saving grace moving forward is likely to be a trait list that is bereft of collection value as of this writing, but shouldn’t be a dud for too much longer. For a one-off crew, you could do much worse, just realize that long-term she profiles as a card prone to continue her extended stretches of irrelevance.
