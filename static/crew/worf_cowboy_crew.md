Early 2021 strapped a rocket pack to The Duke to thrust him into a tie for the collection lead among super rares, including the massive Klingon and Costumed collections for which he'll be essential even years down the line. The other two are more style than substance, but even Holodeck Enthusiasts rewards a Costumed Janeway for finishing crew you may have immortalized anyways. If he was a blank slate otherwise, he'd still be a must-have for any roster in the game.

Luckily Worf is a name of note, nipping on Jim Kirk's heels for the most event features in the history of the game. His variants have picked up a bonus in each of the game's six calendar years and the constable even has a big bonus feature himself, not to mention a comfortable lead for Worf's best CMD at the super rare level. In the two classic long term areas of value for purple crew, collections and event work, Worf is a no brainer.
