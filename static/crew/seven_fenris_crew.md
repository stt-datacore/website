Mighty morphin' Annika is rather underpowered for an Honor Hall crew, nevertheless it’s still another option to spend your hon-- Ah crap, wrong crew with identical art.

CMD/DIP/SUCK was always going to shorten Seven’s shelf life on voyages and indeed her time there should be done unless you’re a new player acquiring three or more stars at once through events. Which is where Fenris will perform best - a luscious skill set for shuttle seating and reasonable base power should have her as a top thaw name for any event bonuses she collects that have a faction component.

A fairly average trait set will do its duty to provide collection value and has already helped pad out her event history. There’s no particularly strong niche ability that Fenris brings to the table, but she’s statistically worthwhile as another option in your roster’s mid-to-late game toolbox.
