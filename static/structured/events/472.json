The phase will last for 96 hours.\n-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- In this event, Gold and Silver skills for Voyages will be DIP and SCI.\n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using Evil Doctor, any version of Phlox, T-Ana, Pollard, Physicians, or Nurses will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the S.S. Eleos XII, the Vidiian Warship, the Borg Sphere, or ships with the Freighter trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Freighter (Ship trait), Evil Doctor, Phlox, T-Ana, Pollard, Physicians, or Nurses","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_ve_infinitecombinations.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":27416,"symbol":"sarah_april_crew","name":"Sarah","full_name":"Sarah April","flavor":"During her life, Sarah made many inventions.
