An extremely Faction-lite card to build, Sulu is a perfunctory midgame leveling “project” for players looking to make the mountainous trudge through the Resourceful collection. Somehow one of the traitiest Sulu variants, the Leftenant has a reasonable collection ceiling, but is functionally useless if you’re not playing “Nightmare Mode”.
