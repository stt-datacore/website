No, you haven't wandered into the Super Rare section, those are Gangster's actual bases. Yet he still manages to dodge those poor numbers and contribute.

The gauntlet is Gangster's game and despite younger SEC/SCI options trying to cozy up to his Thompson (that's a gun, lewd reader), he still owns a top three SEC/ENG pair and top three overall SEC proficiency. His lengthy trait list has him popping up with 45% crit from time to time and gives him a huge number of elevated crit gauntlets.

Spock variants are legendarily rich with traits and Gangster is no exception. This note won't bother telling you how many collections he's in, because that number will change by the time you're reading this. Suffice it to say, he's held value in multiple areas better than anyone would have guessed for a card this old and he even boasts plenty of weekend bonuses if you need help on your tenth requisition shuttle.
