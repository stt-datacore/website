There's some voyage use to be had here, but with a fairly thin trait set and no variants, her mountainous event count may be backwards-looking. Discovery and Hologram have carried dozens of crew to relevance over the years, but it's anyone's guess how many more remain. Zora is primarily a nice collection piece for the mountainous Costume Party with some early game voyage work and a very spotty event future.
