Numbers in the right places for voyages, gauntlet, arena...except, oh yeah, he's five years old. Born to the wrong era, most of his assets no longer hold up in modern Timelines. Attributes of note include a 65% gauntlet set with good proficiencies, but distributed too flatly to make an impact, a dollup of collection value, and frankly strong arena evasion that might find use if you can find a palatable way to fuse him. Judge's event count is probably a bit backwards-looking and his bases are poor, but he's a smidge better than many no-hopers.
