A former global gift who wasn't a "gift" like some poorer cards, you should be thrilled to let Medic Reno take up a crew slot. Hell, let her have two or three for what she offers you. A fantastic voyager with a fantastic skill set, Reno, a year and a half after her debut, is about at the power level that Dr. Pollard *started* at. If you've been using that other medical wonder and have been pleased with her performance over the years, Reno is stepping into a similar performance profile for the future.

Reno's scorecard looks like a compliment sandwich thanks to the Discovery Spam slapped in the middle which is unlikely to be reheated. She's been living mega to mega and with so many large trait pools, her weekend clip should slow down going forward. Luckily things pick back up with her other bread and butter; collections. One of the earliest adopters to quad collections, the time to cash those in is ASAP while you can reap her voyage rewards too. As the old saying goes, 'The best time to plant a Reno was when she came out. The second best time is now.'
