Durango's note used to gush about her huge SEC lead over other variants and that's still true, in a sense. Dark Empath Troi (also known as Naughty Troi, Deanna de Vil, Cruella de Troi, Skunk Troi) nearly matches her base, and with a far better voyage profile is a worthwhile pivot in most situations.

There's a smoking crater where Durango's voyage power used to be, but with her event pedigree, vanity collection spot, and non-standard trait set, she's still a fine mid-range behold target who can pitch in on Troi event shuttles with her first star.
