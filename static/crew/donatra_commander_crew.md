A surprisingly impressive card that rises above bad bases and common skills, thanks to competitive Gauntlet pairs (#2 cumulative proficiency total among 4* crew!), two stat boosting collections, and a snappy, if somewhat wimpy, Attack boost. Romulan events (5) will keep her somewhat relevant, but collection value is where she thrives.
