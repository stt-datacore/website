A case study on why debut numbers matter - Amanda premiered to quite a bit of interest, thanks to an ENG/MED skill set for voyages. But only a year and a half removed, she's starting to fall out of use there on some rosters as she passes voyage rank 200, thanks mostly to mediocre debut stats. There's still value to be had on the right roster, but the clock is ticking. Thin utility elsewhere includes a sketchy trait set for future event work and strong arena EV at six seconds which, like her time on screen, you may wish lasted a bit longer.
