He's an absolute unit. In awe of the proficiency of this lad. Like most gauntleteers, don't let the base and voyage ranks trouble you - he's a gauntlet tour de force with the biggest MED proficiency of any crew in the game.

The chink in his dice rolling armor is a minimum proficiency lower than some common super rares like Mirror Phlox and Nurse Garland - you'll be tilted more than once by low rolls that cost you a matchup you're "supposed to win". But considering the dearth of MED primary crew as the least represented skill in the game and his handy skill set shared by only a handful of crew, his reputation is well earned as a gauntlet Hoss.

Voyages are out of the question, but although his bases are putrid for his rarity, Phlox's traits have given him a respectable event tally to date and you could surely find work for him on requisition shuttles when he's sporting a bonus. His collection value is somewhat capped with 'only' four viable traits, but offering multi-collection goodness already helps soften the blow for adding stars two through five on what is a masterful gauntlet card as its core.
