Pel's a crew you might have to do a double take for to find the value. Her plus trait set bore fruit in the form of Costume Party and it's giant 100 threshold bonuses as well as her first mega; Costumed. Besides that speculative event work (including two big bonus features) and nice-to-have collections, She's also great for an episode 4 DIP node unlock to allow you access to the best mission for rare polyalloys.

Adding breadth to this two-skiller is an arena offering that's similar to Ardra with comparable numbers in some metrics save an admittedly large drop in crit bonus. With offerings for rosters young and old, don't let the lack of a third skill or undersized lobes turn you off from a crew that you should be happy to add stars to.
