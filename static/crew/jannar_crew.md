One of the Super Rare Voyage Exclusives, Jannar, like many decrepit crew of his Rarity, has value only in his Event count and his Traits. This arboreal has collected Collections slowly, almost slothly, but has accumulated two Stat-boosters and a Vanity, and has two more viable Traits for later “content” additions by WRG.
