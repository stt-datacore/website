Guinan herself would tell you that dilithium has no meaning here in the Nexus, as evidenced by the weekday 6-pack she comes from. A motley assortment of crew whose power levels would be universally panned if released today. But if you’re reading this after the fact to see where she can help out your rosters, well, your guess is as good as mine.

True to form, Guinan’s traits are fairly esoteric, but matter not for the gauntlet since, unlike her variant counterparts, she’s a total dud there. Her skill set would play sweetly in the traditional 45%+ gauntlet trait sets which her namesakes enjoy if only she had a shred of proficiency power to wield. Instead you’re looking at +9 arena EV which is a hair slow and handicapped as well as an admittedly great MED base which has qualified for a Faction bonus once in the last 168 weeks. She’s qualified for a Faction bonus once in the last 168 weeks… Worthwhile voyage work for players lacking MED and the uncertainty of the trait mega era salvages her value a bit, but this is not a card you need on your roster beyond the early-mid game, let alone one you should spend dilithium to acquire.
