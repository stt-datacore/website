Enough ruffles and flounces to fill a cathedral, yet the ill-mannered, gluttonous scamp appears to be perched atop Oscar the Grouch's trash can. How ghastly! Ribald by Timelines' standards, Armus' little buddy will undoubtedly be chased by art collectors or those who just want a laugh. Which is probably best, because the crew itself belies his image and manages to be fairly bland. The best Wesley by a mile (if that's your metric for crew evaluation), Little Boy Blue still lags way behind the pack in almost every area. Even some minor variant Event chances (plus Traits) that have him a step ahead of many one-offs are blunted by disappointing bases. With fairly modest pools of Wesleys, Holograms, Prodigies, etc. it's still a "smoke 'em if you got 'em" scenario, even if it's not a big selling point. Voyages are perhaps the one area where Wes might see regular use, at least for the immediate future. A stealth Trait audit post-release added a couple nice Antimatter traits and his power should afford him occasional seating. A "fun" crew with spotty work should hopefully give folks who have him a chuckle.  Like many crew from 2021, Wesley’s long term value is in Collections, and with a thin set of Traits, he’ll likely hit his ceiling at three.
