Oh man, this guy's got everything. He has, uh, Bases...and and he's got...Traits. Just about everything you need in a crew.

In truth, the lack of a third Skill doesn't hurt too much for crew who don't Voyage or Gauntlet anyways, so despite missing a little Shuttle flexibility, Elnor (which is Elvish for 'jumped the shark') floats among dozens if not hundreds of low-end Behold options who will fill an Event Shuttle with a bonus or tick a few Collection boxes.

Shuttle-friendly Bases even give him a better chance to ride shotgun on the weekend than an equivalent power ENG or MED option and future show bonuses aren't entirely outside the realm of possibility. A longtime punchline among Timelines elitists (hey, that's us!), take solace in knowing that Elnor has his uses, even if he's a card that you're generally forced into taking.
