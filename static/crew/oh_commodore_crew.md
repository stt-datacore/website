List of strong Romulan voyagers: Romulan Data back in 2003 or something. That’s the whole list. So should you be using Oh on many voyages? Not really, but that’s such a tough anti-matter seat to nail, she might make a ride or two if you simply lack strong options in her skill set. 

“CMD and SEC” shuttle seats litter event histories going back years and Oh’s worthwhile power level there makes her a strong option when she snags a bonus or even on daily shuttles. The problem is that WRG has not favored her traits very much for events and the likes of Zhat Vash and Tal Shiar may never see a bonus. A comparison can be made to certain base-heavy Sulus or Chekovs in that she will excel when given the chance, but you may have to wait a long time between chances.
