A skill set that used to be rarer, voyage power that used to be useful, and 'dual 1k bases' which used to headline. Now slumped in the stat rank doldrums, Zef's benefits instead are a gorgeous, double-digit smörgåsbord of traits which have provided a monster number of event chances while promising more down the line and some of the most tantalizing collection potential out there.

Face Fuzz Cochrane's pie-in-the-sky theoretical collection maximum is somewhere around nine or ten and would be absurd value for a single crew. He already has a stack of them and should incrementally grow in value while with each new addition we'll remark, "Whoa, I can't believe Mirror Cochrane is in X collections now!"
