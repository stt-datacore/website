The best things in life are free
But you can give them to the birds and bees
I want money
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That’s what I want
(That's what I want)

Your love is such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills
I want money
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That’s what I want
(That's what I want)

Money don't get everything it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
I want money
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That’s what I want
(That's what I want)

I want money
(That's what I want)
I want lots of money
(That's what I want)
In fact, I want so much money
(That's what I want)
Give me your money
(That's what I want)
Just give me money
(That's what I want)
(That's what I want)
