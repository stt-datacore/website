Fitting for his story arc, Sarek at this point in Timelines is merely a victim of his age. He has all the tent poles of a worthwhile, all-round crew, but how useful each of his attributes are will depend on your roster.

Collections are the enduring value here. Like most Vulcans he has a sturdy trait list which results in some immediate collection value and some potential value. The other long term pay off may come in the form of event features. While 2016/17 feels like forever ago, there's no telling if he'll pick up more big bonus features in the future.

A lone 45% gauntlet may let newer players use him once in a while if you can dodge walls of Locutus, but the handicap on his arena ability makes that attribute fools' gold unless you pull off some miraculous timing.
