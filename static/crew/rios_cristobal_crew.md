I was tempted, writing this note, to simply tell you that he's not very good and that you should wait for the better hologram versions to roll in. But that's not the Big Book way, so let's go by the numbers.

Sub-par voyage ranking for the most common skill set in the game: check. CMD base that doesn't break top ten: check. Event count inflated by trait megas that we likely won't see hit again except for the occasional one-off: check. Honestly, the only reason we're talking about him is Picard events, where he'll be useable to obtain better crew. It's a shame such a fun character has been rendered so hol-low (geddit?), but ah well. Maybe he'll be redeemed with a hunky shirtless upgrade somewhere down the line.
