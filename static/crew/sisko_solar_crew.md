Expertly blending a mirror-esque beard with such fatherly traits as Caregiver and Chef, Solar Sisko is a fascinating crew. He has an otherworldly eight collection ceiling, which would have been a goofy conversation to have a few years ago, but can't be dismissed in the midst of WRG's 'collection era'. 

Resourceful having already done the dirty work of getting his least likely trait some tangible value (Sorry HFS, you will never be considered), waiting on some of his other traits to hit seems like a mere formality now. As of this writing he's 'merely' a multi-collection value with a rock solid event history and twilight voyage ability, but could end up sitting atop the collection rankings soon and permanently.
