RIVA'S CHORUS: Welcome to my note, honored friends.

RIVA'S CHORUS BALANCE: I am an experienced mediator. The toil of Shuttles day after day wash against the beachhead of your resolve like an abrading ocean. But I and my chorus manage to squeeze into a single seat through the magic of plot device and will masterfully haul Basic Holoprograms to and fro for you.

RIVA'S CHORUS SCHOLAR: But I know you've looked my name up on a spreadsheet and the ratings aren't great. My substantial DIP Base, while perfectly in keeping with a legend of my stature, will find few chances to be of much use with my esoteric Trait set and my lack of a third Skill means I will never set foot on a Voyage. Although, if we're being honest, even the second Skill is a stretch. Do I look like a scientist?

RIVA'S CHORUS WARRIOR: Nerds, they tend to ramble, neglect the Collections. I am passion, the libido. I am the anarchy of Stat boosts, the romantic and the lover. I am also the Traits, the perfect lineup which WRG never gets wrong. You will never have another chance to use your Ramatis III Native Polestar. Retrieve me now and I will fill your Collections with fire and desire. Aaaand dance break!
