Card art showing Scott Bakula’s frontula (someone fan me) is not even the most impressive part of this crew. Let’s start with that great #2 base rank. While stellar, keep in mind that it’s still miles behind #1 Sato.

Anyone else he’ll have covered and though his event chances are wanting, DIP is a common enough Faction seat for him to pick up non-bonus work from time to time and have his own private chair for daily runs.

For voyages, he’s a fantastic counterpart to former mega Cornwell and even maintains a top 10 MED+CMD total despite being DIP primary. In the gauntlet, though far from dominant, he owns a top three ranked pair and may make your starting five should the traits align in his favor. A truly elite daily use crew who we can only hope has a sharp uptick in events.
