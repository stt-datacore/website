If there's one thing that Grey's Anatomy has taught me, it's that you can't be a great surgeon without being a massive prick. That being said, Dr. Russell should be the number one MED crew until the end of time.

Her favourable skill set isn’t even worth mentioning for Gauntlet anymore, so until more of her traits turn into Collections, she's hard to justify as a slot-stealer on rosters that need space and instead makes for fine airlock material. Hey Toby! How do you like it when someone plays fast and loose with YOUR life, jerk?
