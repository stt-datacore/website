Some very middle of the road stats for a three skilled PokeCaptain but they score high enough to make him the best Voyager in the Uncommon collection. He has a ton of traits but fills the role that the other starter captains in that he is wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle. +3 attack in ship battles is a fairly good early game ability and he fills two extra collections when immortalised.
