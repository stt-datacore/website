If you aren’t singing “Dahj On The Run” to yourself to the rune of a certain song, what are you even doing here?!

We’ve got to quibble about a DIP Primary for a character who gets into multiple extended fight sequences with murderous teleporting aliens that feature Dahj giving back suplexes, leaping fifty yards into the air, and breaking ankles. But in the spirit of Power Crept™ DIP Bases, at least it’s a big one!

Dahj’s event chances are murky. If she’s not manning requisition Shuttles without a bonus, there’s no telling how long between weekend junkets she may go. Star Trek: Picard-based bonuses are a possibility, if not very likely. There’s also the fact that she and Soji won’t share any variant events, further limiting her utility. Worthwhile Base metrics and DIP’s ubiquitous seating should give Dahj spots to contribute, but they won’t be regular. A trio of Collections and a ceiling of anywhere from four to six, depending on how long this game is on fumes, would give her lasting value, at least longer than she lasted on screen. SPOILERS!
