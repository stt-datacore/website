Even if you're a Dapper Dan man, it's hard to recommend Amanda's prisoner (He's missing that trait, WRG) too heartily. Regency is actually above average for a 2-skill crew in that he'll catch fairly regular event work and has a trio of 45% gauntlets, but the downsides are apparent.

Poor bases make room for respectable proficiencies which unfortunately run up against the concurrently-debuting Balok and his hefty CMD/DIP roll. His debonair duds and occasional use should soften the behold blow if you're not happy to see him; there are far worse fish in the sea.
