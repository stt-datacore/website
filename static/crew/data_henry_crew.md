If I had a dollar for every "solid" Data write-up I've done, I'd have V. Thank you, I'm here all week. Feel free to skim the other ENG primary Data notes if you want an idea of what you'll be getting in general - King Data profiles similarly.

Used-to-be a voyager, like several other Datae, Mr. Vee is pointed at events these days. With multiple events in every calendar year, Data is not likely a name to lose steam any time soon on the weekends. Beyond that it's all about the collection tab, where it's not hard to see Data stack up V or more collection spots when it's all said and done.
