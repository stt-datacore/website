“This is getting out of hand! Now, there are two of them!”. You may be feeling a bit like a certain Neimoidian Viceroy of the Trade Federation when you realise that we get not one, but two Vadic Variants in the same week! For those of us whose hearts she immediately laughed her way into (maniacally, of course), there will be no complaints!

Much like her 4* self, Captain Vadic can be put to use aboard your shuttles, albeit with a lot more staying power this time. Debuting with a Top 10 CMD Base and a respectable SEC Secondary, she’ll expand your versatility in Faction events when her traits are called (and who knows, we may get a Picard theme one day!), or fill in on dailies if one of your better options is off Voyaging. Speaking of Voyages, she’s top of the class in a number of her trait + skill combos, meaning extra antimatter and skill points towards your Voyage length goals.

Standing…sitting…now we just need an action pose Vadic. But until then, enjoy her 2 Stat-Boosting Collections and cross your fingers for a few more down the line.
