As is customary with Super Rare “skillets”, we look toward Events and Collections. The former isn't very flashy, but Jake Sisko's great Faction ratio for his Events counts for something as does his handful of big bonus features. The latter helps him avoid dud territory and should be eventually sought as you sew up the non-Legendary portion of your Collections, but he's far from an essential crew before that point and not valuable outside of those areas. Don’t sleep on Jake, even though he looks pretty old and tired at this point, since he has four Collections as it stands, including the tough Writer one.
