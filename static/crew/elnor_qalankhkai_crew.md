So, here it is - the true test of campaign resistance. When the Uber campaign track was introduced, the question has been just how the exclusive crew would be balanced, or, indeed, if they would be. Three crew in, the question is laid bare. How much are you willing to pay for pure power? With an abnormally light collection tally for a 2022 crew (how ever will WRG fill out their campaign announcement notes now?), an event count so skant you'd see it walking around the Enterprise-D circa 2363, and an anaemic Gauntlet profile, Elnor is a voyager first and foremost. He's almost a voyager first and only, but the ship ability, while hampered by a Position trigger, does still add some value. So where does this leave the Elvish boy wonder, so three dimensional, memorable and nuanced that the art for this variant is just his two skill variant with his sword not drawn? 

For starters, Elnor is the #1 pick for three of his four AM traits, including the neglected Romulan seat - only Fencing Picard has him pipped for Duelist, and with raw power like this, he should be riding almost every voyage even without a trait match. In four years, he'll be sitting pretty where most other crew debut, putting him squarely in the 'later losers' part of the score curve. And yet . . . not only is this the fourth top ten voyager to debut in the last six months, but he's also the third of those voyagers to be some variation of CMD/DIP/SEC. Much like his on-screen persona, Elnor lacks depth to make up for this blandness. Power like this is being printed more frequently than it has been for a while, especially in this flavour, and with each one printed, all the others wallow and crumple and lose just a little bit more sparkle. 

There are only twelve seats on any given voyage, six of which can hold crew with this skill set. Did you pull packs for Admiral Jameson or Fencing Picard, perhaps even dupe them? Did Returning Saru or Lieutenant Sahil get insta-cited, maybe even duplicated after fortunate recaps? Then you have to ask yourself, just how much of an improvement to your roster is Elnor, really? Will he be the shot in the arm that your voyages need, or a complete luxury? He is, objectively, a very strong card, and to take him in the Uber Behold is definitely not the wrong choice. 

And yet. 

How many CMD/DIP/SEC voyagers does it take, Admiral, before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand? A million? How many CMD/DIP/SEC voyagers does it take, Admiral?
