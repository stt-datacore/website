One of many event/collection super rares you'll gather and freeze en route to a well-rounded roster. Most impressive is probably his handful of big bonus features across several different events. That will almost always elicit a thaw and a splash of collection value never hurts to justify their crew slot as you gather stars, especially as Odo offers zero daily use.
