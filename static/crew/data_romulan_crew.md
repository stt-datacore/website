Romulan Data, having come Nimoy-approved, enjoyed a great run in the game’s early years. Having spent time wearing many hats - voyager, shuttler, event stalwart - he’s earned his spot in the old crew rest home. As you know, there are two points of interest there; events and collections.

Data variant events read peak, valley, peak, but have regardless popped up multiple times in each calendar year and it’s clear that he’s an unforgettable character. With enough traits to pad out his more impressive years, he should continue being an oft-thawed crew for years to come. 

Collections aren’t quite as big a boon for him. He has an average or better number of viable traits, but his first two collections are on the small side which presents multiple issues in the long run. Still, as the “two” in his one-two value punch, they bring enough to the table to help you feel better about seeing him in a behold.

With only a “Hey, what if we gave Ardra a cloak trigger” ship ability for additional usage, this variant’s best days are behind him, but he shouldn’t slip too much further down the overall ranks.
