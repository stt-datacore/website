A Jack of most trades, this Sisko tops no power charts, but contributes a little bit everywhere. His Trait tendrils run throughout the card, boosting his sagging Voyage credentials two years after debut via a six-pack of Antimatter Traits and his non-HFS Traits have all had at least one Event bonus previously. 

Bankable Event work looks extra appealing with his variant-best Bases, even if his Skills aren't those you'll most often see on Sisko Event Shuttles (it only takes one seat). Debuting with two of his four viable Traits ticking a Collection box, it seems only a matter of time before the others join them and make him a juicy Collection/Event pairing who will ride out the waves of waning Voyage power to deliver long term value.
