While this particular variant is as boring as dollar store vanilla ice cream, she’s still a warm and able body for the Faction queen as owner of the top super rare Janeway CMD. A narrow window as a quick arena accuracy crew would seemingly be her only other use - but wait! There’s more!

Just like Tuvix and the Duras Sisters, this particular Janeway can be fused with Mutated Paris to form Evolved Janeway, an above average legendary with quality DIP/SCI and a place in every Voyager fan’s heart. Don’t be so quick to airlock her when you see her anymore - each copy is one step closer to that great big salamander in the sky.
