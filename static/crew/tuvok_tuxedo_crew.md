Where's Tuvok's MED? You call this guy a bartender? Barvok is another funny little quirk in Timelines' history; he was overlooked in what was supposed to be his debut to the portal and wasn't added until a year later. If you're getting a late start on him, welcome to the wonderful world of events and collections.

To be completely honest, WRG done did Tuvok dirty. Not collecting half as many features as he deserves, that trend may continue or perhaps it will be addressed, but should be kept in mind regardless. On the flip side, the trait shelf behind him is stocked with every kind of peaty, malted, oaky, and sweet you might have a thirst for and have helped keep this particular variant relevant in years where he would have been a total dud.

Worm aside, you'll be slamming Tuvok's tequila shots every few months as his traits unlock additional collections to add to what is already excellent value coming from his spots in multiple large collections. Barvok is no longer an option for daily use (don't drink and drive, folks), but is fine post-cryo value with a ceiling higher than most.
