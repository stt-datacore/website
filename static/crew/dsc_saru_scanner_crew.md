It's a relatively safe bet to say that Mr. Shape of Water has peaked - his two best collection chances have hit and Disco megas are presumably finished. While Saru has gotten a shocking amount of event work from those two little traits in the time since, one would expect their summer seasons to cool as well. Still a worthwhile super rare to behold for the aforementioned reasons, just not one likely to increase in value any time soon.
