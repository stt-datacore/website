A former “meh” power giveaway crew, Sarek has somewhat been the gift that keeps on giving. He probably hasn’t sniffed much daily use for anyone in years, but the trait era has been good to him, providing prodigious event and collection value that should abide for a while longer.

Still afloat on the weekends in a post-Disco world, Sarek’s trait and event his variants should be good for at least a couple events yearly with the odd mega power spike from time to time. And his quartet of collections could potentially double in count if players call WRG’s bluff and see just how committed they are to maintaining monthly collections.

With some very usable triggerless arena damage available at one star, Sarek offers value via some non-traditional avenues, even if he’s best enjoyed by late game, established rosters.
