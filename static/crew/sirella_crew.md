We are not accorded the luxury of choosing the card we fall in love with. Do you think Sirella is anything like the woman I thought that I would want to win in an event or pick from a behold? She is a prideful, arrogant, mercurial woman, who gets voyage antimatter bonuses far too infrequently for my taste. And yet...I love her, deeply. We players often tout our prowess in events and voyages, our desire for glory and honor sales above all else. But how hollow is the sound of victory without strong character choices to share it with. Pure numbers cards give little comfort to a player alone in their home...and in their heart.

While Jadzia may question the veracity of Sirella's Royalty trait, the rest of the card is exactly as it appears - aged out of daily usability and waiting on traits. If you’re waiting on a variant power refresh, keep an eye out for Senator Tal'aura.
