That art is merely Ezri looking for some shred of value. It may exist in the form of her full cadet coverage on weekdays, but Uncommon options exist and will outclass her without too much trouble. Lacking any collection cushion as fallback, donâ€™t feel too bad about showing Ezri the airlock until the much ballyhooed Trill collection hits.
