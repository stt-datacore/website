Crew with any substantial amount of MED almost never have trouble finding a home on rosters. His events are frequent enough to elevate a variant-best DIP base and a serviceable gauntlet pair collects 45% crit from time to time. The MEDaissaince has left him singing a little out of tune,  though, thanks to his voyage credentials being, to put it bluntly, kicked in the nads by no less than two fantastic mega crew fairly close to each other. Useful in spurts, if unspectacular.
