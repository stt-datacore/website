On release, we were probably a little unkind to Commodore Oh, and while some of our criticism of everyone's favourite Commodore (or general, or whatever she's calling herself now) is still warranted, she's definitely on the sunnier side of daily use. Two collections, including the show favourite Romulan and the event frontrunner Vulcan, a hidden Picard trait, useable voyage stats, plus a +10 Arena attack at 8 seconds with no trigger, mean that if you tripped and fell into copies of her, then you're almost certainly using her. That being said, a meh skill set and zer-Oh use in Gauntlet mean that in a year her prospects are a little less rosy, especially if Picard show events continue to fail to materialise, meaning that unless you want her for the art or to rent out the collection slot, it's not hard to justify taking a pass on her treacherous Tal Shiar ass.
