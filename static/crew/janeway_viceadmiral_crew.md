A favorite of The Big Book staff for a bouffant hairstyle that puts Worf to shame, this Vice cops to being a bigger badass than Worf too. Great bases, including a variant-dominating CMD, perform Admirably throughout fistfuls of bonuses from Janeway's events and two scoops of traits. Her voyage power is the side dish here, but does well enough as a top ten CMD/ENG option to garner weekly work and make her an enticing option for citations.
