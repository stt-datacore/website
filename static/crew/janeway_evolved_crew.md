From the depths of a coffee-starved writers' room comes this curious monstrosity. Fusing Captain Janeway and Mutated Paris will produce this love child and her love children.

Usable base and voyage numbers laugh in the face of the Bynars in terms of usability and Janeway events guarantee to provide periodic value for a variant-best DIP base that edges out other beholdable options by a significant margin.

Her voyage power isn't what it once was and may even be scoffed at if this were a current release, but being able to build-a-bear your way to a legendary crew has a value of its own and is far preferable to the paltry sum of honor you'd get for airlocking a handful of extra super rares.
