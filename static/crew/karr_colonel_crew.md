The Notorious K.A.R.R. is well known for the lowest primary base among super rares and the second worst 3-skill voyage total. But flying under the radar are his +1 Veteran, 65% gauntlet crit trait set paired with a top five CMD roll, and fantastic skirmish offense. Hold your nose when selecting him for his latter talents.
