Former Mega Event Recurring Legendaries tend to loom large in the collective memory of the game, and this Bashir variant is now much closer to a Dark Lord of the Shit than the Dark Lord of the Sith. His Voyage power has melted away in the face of this trashcan fire to leave behind a trim one-two punch of Collections and Event chances. A Grand Slam (that’s four for non-baseball enjoyers) of Collections give him above average metrics there for his Rarity, and Bashir gets a reasonable amount of variant Events to go with his ancillary Trait chances.
