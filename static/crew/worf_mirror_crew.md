Outside of an occasional gauntlet fifth when he hits on his pair of 45% trait sets, the Regent is unlikely to be of use for you day to day. Where he shines, however, are collections and the two scoops of events he's been bonus for with traits that support further regular weekend work. Taking stars for a legendary with such poor daily stats is often hard to justify, but two of his collection spots should remain relevant for years, while he will make plenty of shuttles with a bonus once you've fused him for those collections.
