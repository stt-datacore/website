From a moment in Discovery that even TOS-ers can appreciate, Pike fittingly has signed up for the long haul. Besides some new player utility on ships, provided you can acquire enough stars, he points mainly towards late game.

The Disco storm seems to have passed, leaving a quiet 2020/21 in its wake for most Pike variants, but Strange New Worlds could be his salvation, even if only for the bevy of variant events we’re likely to see. Having not gotten much event help from traits either, that can only improve in the future and his multi-collection status should slowly tick upwards. Boreth is not a do-it-all savior in the early game, but can be a fine tool to have at your disposal if you’re at the point where you don’t ask for much from your super rares on a daily basis.
