This ol' country doctor used to bullseye tribbles in his T-16 back home - luckily that experience has made him pretty okay for ship battles. A notch below stalwarts like Laborer Spock or Admiral Janeway, you can still leverage McCoy's strong and quick evasion in the arena or for some free hull repair during skirmishes.

The backbone of this crew are his non-human/federation/starfleet traits which provide everything from anti-matter and event bonuses to collection value. His run of the mill SCI base is tops by far for McCoy variants and ranks highly among Physicians as well.

The downside here is his voyage work. While certainly usable in the short term, DIP/SCI/MED is more populated than you might think and with a debut voyage rank that's far from optimal, Tribbled might not make it to two full years of service in this area for many rosters.
