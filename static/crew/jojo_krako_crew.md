At this point, you may be sensing a theme to Super Rare crew being released into the game these days. They fall into one of two categories: big Collections now, or big Collections later.

Jojo Krako joins us via a Tuesday Pack and from one of the most memorable episodes of The Original Series, “A Piece of the Action”. So, if you got him from his Tuesday Pack, or eventually when he joins the portal, you can stick him on a bridge with Gangsters Spock and Kirk, and in time his various traits will reward your investment with notches on future Collections such as Duelist and Maverick. Something something joke about Lotian versus Iotian and how WRG’s attention to detail isn’t great something something?
