This Pokémon is still a worthy voyager for many early to mid-game rosters, but considering his skill set and deficiencies elsewhere, that’s not a worthwhile payout for an extremely expensive build of 100+ faction items and several 4* components. With a hologram mega in the rear view mirror, his return on investment just walked off the holodeck and disappeared into thin air.
