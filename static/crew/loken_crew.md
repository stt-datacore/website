Loken's ranking anywhere above, say, a ham sandwich has almost everything to do with the ENG/MED part of his skill set which will help you attack the universal weak point of any player's voyage lineup. If you need help trying to shore up those runs, and we all do, your options will be limited and Loken can at least do that. His underachieving bases will rarely help you between three bad traits in one hand and a few superior ENG mega crew in the other. Which leaves an eight second arena nuke as his only other worthwhile attribute if you can meet its cloak requirement. Any utility beyond that, you're Lo-ken in all the wrong places.

By the way, I have Ham Sandwich around tier 8. Solid whole wheat base will make some shuttle runs when bonus, but few condiments limit his voyage and event potential.
