Though his offerings may be rather less than first class (rimshot!), Off-Brand Tom Paris can make some slim contributions to a roster with very specific needs. If you haven’t had the chance to collect any of the heavy CMD bases released recently, he’s slightly more interesting than some just because, despite his only two skills being flying dangerous manoeuvres badly enough that someone died and lying through his teeth, he’s actually a Lorca-esque #5 CMD/DIP voyager, though you obviously want to be cultivating a healthy enough roster that you don’t want to be relying on two skill crew who are keeping Vargas company.

Beyond that, he’s a quick (4s) +10 EV boost in the Arena, which might help you keep the Krayton at bay, but that’s about all he can offer, since he lacks truly eventable traits and I wouldn’t advise you to pin any hopes on Maverick. If you pick him, it’ll be because your first duty is to the character, and not to his raw statistical offerings.
