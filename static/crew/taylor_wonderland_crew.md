Y’all have been waiting for more additions to your YMCA bridge crew, here you go! ‘Hands up’ means SEC primary in the 20th century; the time period where the Displaced Taylor comes from and has lived in her entire life…

Enough grousing, this is a legitimate voyager with some ooh la la thanks to a unique skill order across all rarities. That automatically catapults her efficacy upwards and in combination with a strong anti-matter hit rate, worthy raw power, and willingness to chow down on pizza and beer earns Gillian the citation green light from us for the foreseeable future.

There’s painfully few toppings on this thin crust pie otherwise - her collection profile is meh, her event chances are slim, and there just isn’t enough proficiency power to put her excellent skill set to use in the gauntlet as well. If you’ve been looking for a voyage citation project, look no further. For all other considerations, it’s best to leave her pounding on the hull of the Bounty.
