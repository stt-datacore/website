As we've been tapping our foot for Strange New Worlds, Ye Olde Disco Pike has been dropping ranks. No longer really suitable for daily work, this Pike is a matter of events and collections - both of which are at the mercy of an uncertain future. There's a strong chance Anson mounts an event comeback when SNW drops, just don't let his third skill trick you into thinking he's a worthwhile option day to day.
