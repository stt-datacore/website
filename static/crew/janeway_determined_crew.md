The natural predator to coffee cups and sonic showers everywhere, this steely Janeway variant has aged better than perhaps anyone thought. Outfitted with the megaphone for years at the bow of your Voyage row boat, her ranks no longer keep up with newer releases.

Meanwhile her Base metrics have held strong and though Janeway Events are oddly stop-and-start, there's zero chance WRG cuts her loose permanently. With front-loaded Collection potential, her small room for growth in that area takes a back seat to a slew of Collections which are just begging to be finished with fantastic all-round crew like Detway.
