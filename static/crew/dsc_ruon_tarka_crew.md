Well, it’s not Q’s candy corn version of the future, but Wesley Crusher’s all grown up and ready to get an A.

To do so, he’s going to need to leverage his Traits to provide an edge. On Voyages, Tarka has serviceable power in a rare-ish Skill set, so between that and his Traits for seating purposes, he’ll pitch in for many rosters. 

Similarly in Events, his Traits have snagged enough bonuses in the times after the Discovery Mega Event era to earn him occasional play on the weekends. With his well-known Wesley Traits in hand like Prodigy and Scoundrel, we’re likely to see Tarka’s Collection count rise as well. Though not an outstanding option anywhere in particular, you can expect to utilize this crew from time to time across a few different areas.
