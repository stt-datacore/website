Zora has been reborn from the fires of Discovery Mega Events as not only the sentient computer of the ship (that’s not a trope we’ve ever seen!) but as a solid Collection piece and Fleet Boss Battles Node solver. Three Collections plus another pair of untapped Traits add up to five (yes, we do the math for you here at bigbook.app), so safely Fuse her up at your leisure and cash in.
