Averaging less than an event per year qualifies him for the dreaded "non-event 2-skiller" category. With no collections or daily work to save him, he's worse crew than his skill set and average bases suggest. If you have him on your roster from voyages or a straight pack drop, you’ll be crossing your fingers for his only vaguely eventable trait, Prodigy, to make its first appearance. Before you freeze him, have him unlock a node for you.
