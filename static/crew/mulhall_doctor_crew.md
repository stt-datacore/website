Another Pre-laski progenitor, Mulhall has proven more a spreadsheet warrior than roster cornerstone. With only two traits to supplement her 'big base', the Big Book branded "Empty Calories crew™️" would seem to apply here, though the value one gets out of shuttle bases varies largely from player to player.

If you're looking for a supplementary payoff for your investment, it's solely some thin collection value. Mulhall would be pegged as a much more comfortable investment if her stats were attached to repeat value like a main cast name or more eventable traits.
