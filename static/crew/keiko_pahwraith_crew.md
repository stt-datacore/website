The former drummer of The Oneders, Keiko's outrageous CMD base is as impressive and baffling now as the day she was released. While a #1 base is a significant attribute, if you have someone like the über popular #2 FO Burnham, Keiko may be somewhat redundant for non-bonus shuttle work. Nevertheless, that huge base keeps her among the more usable non-event crew and allow her to contribute even with other zeroes across the board. Bad peripheral attributes (arena/collections/gauntlet/skill set/event count/voyage power) hamstring her flexibility, if not her usability.
