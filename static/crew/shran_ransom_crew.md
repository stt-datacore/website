I’m going to tell my kids this is the Mayor of Smurf Village. 

Co-headlining the “Let it Snow” campaign a mere three months after his debut might have been Shran’s notable high point thus far. Providing usable base and voyage metrics at the time, Shran has aged out of voyages by now due to skill set and is hopefully near the low point in terms of value. 

While his bases will never be better than they are now, a rosy future forecast could compensate for stat droopage with a few more collections and continued smattering of megas. Shran’s only a bit player, even for a super rare, but has the right skills to warrant the thaw for events and has a reasonable collection outlook for crew on the short end of tiers.
