A strong ENG base for your…*checks notes* Hirogen node unlocks? Co-founder of the Trait Watchers diet plan (we see you, Damar), Donik is hardly more than a notch on the Innovator collection - a trait which doesn’t appear on a ton of galaxy map nodes. Despite his limited cadet eligibility, this is not a crew you want to level until you’re almost done with the rest of the Rare crew.
