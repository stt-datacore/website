In America, we celebrate the 4th of July with fireworks, BBQ and loud music – the hallmarks of independence from King George III. How does WRG celebrate Independence Day? Not with a Bill Pulman speech, but with a long-requested card from a great Voyager episode. 

Gotana-Retz was, to his people, a pioneer and innovator.  Stuck in a displaced time-bubble on his planet where each day was equivalent to a passing second aboard the orbiting Voyager, Retz bravely explored space and the ‘Sky Ship’ to find what was the magical ship in the sky. He met the crew of Voyager, where earlier the Doctor had been sent to live out 3 years on the planet for information on the inhabitants. Eventually, Gotana-Retz developed technology to free Voyager from the planet’s orbit and go on about the journey home. Freedom!

Lucky for you, WRG saw fit to make sure Gotana-Retz embodied all these traits upon launch!  Coming in hot with 5 bonus trait matches and a top 50 unboosted Voyage score, he will find use among your 12 hour rosters – that is unless you are stacked to the gills with AGIMUS, Mirror Mariners, COP Founders or shadow covered Selas. Even still, the big allure to get you to part ways with your dilithium (that you can always buy more of at store.startrektimelines.com, updated today!) is that he launches with 5 Stat-Boosting Collections, and a 25% Hull Repair/ACC ship ability.

As Tuesday Pack fodder goes, he could always be better -  but he certainly could be miles worse. Chase only if you love temporal displacement episodes, Daniel Dae Kim, Voyager, America, temporal displacement episodes, and there is nothing on TV to watch but Independence Day 2: We Couldn’t Afford Will Smith.
