We’re not sure what T’Pol is summoning with all those candles, but let’s hope it’s help for the backlogged WRG staff. One of several crew buffed post-release in a short period, T’Pol needed the help, but is now sitting pretty. 


Serviceable on voyages and in events, the Subcommander probably better fits the mold of event release aimed at newer players, but hits on a few different areas. Veterans might turn their noses up at only a single debut collection, though that landscape changes month to month at warp speed. And her top MED and DIP bases among super rare variants should earn her cryo reprieve for almost any level of roster. Not a standout name, but one that could see repeated use, especially for younger accounts.
