There’s a reason your awful weatherman is still employed - forecasting is hard. In days of yore, the Princess boasted ample stat ranks and had just gobbled up seven Dax bonuses in one year. Some time after that, as her numbers fell and the crowd of Super Rares surged past her in collection value, the commoners began sharpening the guillotine. 

Now she’s once again on the upswing and we’re advising you to Buy, Buy, Buy! Even if Jadzia is an easy freeze for players past the early game, she comes preloaded with strong collection value (including room to grow) and a prolific event portfolio which has seen her traits carry Jadzia through lean years for variant events.
