Another annoyingly awesome Kes! DB must love the character more than the actress did. She has the #2 MED base with a respectable proficiency bonus to grant her some use in Gauntlet. She can participate in all weekend missions and somehow manages to, again, outperform some of the actual Doctors in the game. Her ship ability grants +10000 crit bonus which will be useful to those who like to inflict some quick damage but donâ€™t expect to see her too much in voyages nor does she fulfill any extra collection rewards. However for pure MED performance, swap out the Doctor for the Ocampan.
