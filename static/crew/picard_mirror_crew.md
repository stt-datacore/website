There may be more iconic crew to outsiders based on their art or episode, but for longtime Timelines players, there’s no one more (in)famous than MJLP.

A late 2017 crew, the Gun Show is still stacking bodies at a pace we’d never have guessed. Going from new player attributes to old, he’s still a Gauntlet name to know. Yes, he’s a “glorified 2-Skiller” and will never dominate in [should not have designed a card like this, you dorks] fashion like Balok, but still owns a competitive CMD/SEC pair and a tremendous number of elevated Gauntlet sets, especially the 45ers. With five of the six of them also featuring one of his Skills, he’ll have his chances to put that rifle to use.

There will be Events a-plenty for Sir Patrick and his bushel of Traits. His Event history is impressive and despite being a “Gauntlet crew”, CMD/SEC, well, commands ample seating for Events and so at five stars he should still ride one of your core four Shuttles or be on an early requisition wave.

Collections are the ornamental bracelet on MJLP (fun fact: that was added to the art post-release) and his quartet of collections could still double in count by the time it’s all said and done thanks to his bevy of Traits. Sure, the power isn’t top shelf anymore due to age, but Pat is still rockin’ it as an older gentleman and is a primo Behold or Crew Retrieval option for rosters young and old.
