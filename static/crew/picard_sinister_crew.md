You can run from it. Hide from it. CMD/DIP/SUCK will find you. 

Sinister earned a reputation quickly after release and has definitely performed well to date, but he’s been hammered in his strongest area; voyages. Everywhere from events to Tuesday packs to megas to giveaways, the CDS skill set has flooded the top of the voyage charts and is calling for Picard’s demise a lot sooner than maybe he deserves. That sounds alarmist, especially considering his primo set of anti-matter seats, but he’s no longer that name which was on the lips of everyone mulling their first crew retrieval.

The good news is Sinister is still a fun character. You can stretch his proficiencies into gauntlet ability thanks to a quartet of 45% crit sets and reliable Picard events in league with some eventable traits have given him plenty of chances at piloting shuttles with a bonus. His meager collection count is sure to grow and he still has a few years of voyage ability left - Sinister Picard remains a solid card. Now c’mon, say his name in a saucy French accent.
