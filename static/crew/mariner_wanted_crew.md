Er, wait, wrong bad horse, sorry about that. This particular one bucks off and tramples an overconfident Mariner on the holodeck. Toe-may-toe, poh-tah-toe.

Wanted Mariner should be just that, wanted. By accounts elderly and new, if those Prisoner Beholds ever come around again. I mean, LD fans rejoice but just look at that art! Sheâ€™s far more than that though, as Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™d be the first to tell you.

Bested in her Triplet by only FBB grind reward Chances Taken Kirk, Mariner is a Voyage monster. With both raw power and a bevy of AM seating traits, sheâ€™ll be a dominant force for ages to come even when itâ€™s not a CMD/ENG Voyage. And when sheâ€™s not Voyaging, sheâ€™ll be hopping aboard your daily shuttles (or Faction Event ones, remember those aforementioned traits?) as the latest member of Club BigBaseâ„¢.

Tier One is reserved for the absolute best of the best, and she rightfully doesnâ€™t find herself in there. But you donâ€™t need her to be good at Gauntlet or Arena, sheâ€™ll have have a job on your roster and sheâ€™ll do it well. Three Stat-Boosting Collections and possibly two-more are just icing on the cake for this maverick 19th Century outlaw. So grab the reins, hop on, and try to stay in the saddle long enough to cite up this crewmember the moment you find her.
