Daily work was an option back when this Kim debuted (and everything was truly in black and white), but his ranks have taken a mighty tumble since then and leave in their wake two points of interest; collections and events. Both are better than you'd expect for a sidekick.

Two collections span the spectrum from vanity to monstrous 100 threshold stat-booster and he's fairly essential for both. And as the best (only) non-gold SEC option for Kim events, he's probably worth the thaw there too. Despite never making lieutenant, Kim's event count is significant, keeping pace with the likes of Spock and Sisko.
