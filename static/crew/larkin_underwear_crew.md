Larkin's second variant is essentially a carbon copy of the first. A thumb on the scales tipping more power to Underwear's voyage score is pointless as it's still horrible, so you'd probably prefer Edward's better base if given the option. Regardless, both cards are primarily collection fodder with the occasional event bonus, even if blanket Discovery megas are a thing of the past.
