Despite Burnham's strong reputation at higher rarities, this windswept variant won't offer much to your roster. The highlight is a SCI stat which qualifies for cadet missions four days per week, but sits behind the more popular (alien) Uncommons; T'Pol and Jadzia. There's little else of note besides a relatively expensive cost to equip.
