For a single star, not many crew can pack a punch like Ol' Crazy Eyes. Outside of the gauntlet, Gowron's numbers are an embarassment, but inside the cage, he's quite the mauler. Owning the #2 DIP proficiency and DIP/SEC pair along with a few 45% trait sets is formidable ammunition, no matter how well developed your starting five is.

His pair of potent collections also presents Gowron in an interesting light. How much value can WRG pack into a crew who's sub-basement level for shuttles and voyages? While his last four stars have always been among the worst return on investment in the game, two spots in two large collections make the Trek to immortalization at least an option for endgame players.
