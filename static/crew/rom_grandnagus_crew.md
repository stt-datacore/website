He was the first legendary with his skill set, but now that number is into double digits. With horrific numbers in every corner of this card (including a 10-26 CMD proficiency), Quark's brother has to hang his hat on an uncommon skill set and Rom/Ferengi events for relevance. His ENG base is #3 among Ferengi, but with his 4/4 version besting him until FF, it's more often theoretical value for a crew who rarely deserves additional stars.
