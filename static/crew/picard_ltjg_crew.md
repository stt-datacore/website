This master-of-none Picard variant will likely be eschewed by veteran players, especially those chasing the golden collection carrot. The object of Riker’s derision, Lt. Picard has scarcely more than his ship ability with which to make a favorable impression.

Newer players may find a bit more meat on the bone, but a severe lack of traits hamstrings him in every area except perhaps voyage anti-matter seating. This is merely a card who sells himself on the back of his appearance in the fan favorite episode Tapestry.
