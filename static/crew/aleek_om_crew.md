Word to Big Bird! If you're a new player, I hope you've been saving for this debut Galaxy event. A collection piece with good-not-great numbers and a SCI/MED stack that will stick around your voyage runs for a while, Aleek-Om is just the kind of crew you'd love to get four copies of early on. Unfortunately, the lack of events and a shallow trait pool means that once frozen, he'll stay frozen. Those who have the Innovator collection done and/or certain allergies can pass, but newer players should tap tap tap this weekend.
