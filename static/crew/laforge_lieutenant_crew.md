Strong engineering and a three skilled proficiency make this one of the better blues to keep hold of. Although he can't contribute towards cadet missions he will certainly be useful on voyages and shuttles, he might even get some work during an event or two. There are better engineers available but you can't go wrong with La Forge if O'Brian or Lefler haven't dropped yet.
