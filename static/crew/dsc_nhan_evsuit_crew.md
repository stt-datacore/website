I bet you were expecting a ton of Indian cuisine jokes in this note, weren't you? Well, there'll be Nhan of that Nhansense here, this is a professional endeavor, written by professionals.

Nhan's still viable on voyages and her ENG secondary does a great job of breaking up an all too common SEC/CMD stack. Unfortunately her traits let her down and won't elevate a fairly common overall skill set that could use the help.

She's more proficient on daily shuttles thanks to tiny proficiencies that lead to less tiny bases. Event work, however, is another story. Nhan is no household name and, again, that lack of traits comes back to bite her here. With only Discovery buoying her bonus chances, it would seem that her best event days are behind her. If you're one of those Discovery holdouts who believe their megas are merely hibernating, well, tikka seat and hope for some fiery vinda(loo)cation.
