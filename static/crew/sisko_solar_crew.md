Expertly blending a mirror-esque beard with such fatherly traits as Caregiver and Chef, Solar Sisko is a fascinating event crew. Holding the #2 ENG and SCI bases for Sisko variants, he was recently dethroned from the top ENG spot which hurts more than helps, but may bring more ENG seating opportunities to Sisko events. A trait lineup spilling into double digits helps enhance his chances on the weekend and also some adaquate voyage potential. Double collection spots and slow-but-strong arena EV round him out.
