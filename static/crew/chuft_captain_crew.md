Unfortunately, formerly worthwhile Voyage power has waned, but Chuft-Captain’s enduring value is his solid Trait set (and fabulous Constellation to pull from a Scan).  His Traits may not have triggered much in the way of Events or Collections yet, but he profiles as a crew who one could easily see increase in value over time.

Giving him another leg to stand on, Chuft is quite unique on Ships as well. An Evasion and uses-per-battle handicap is easily compensated for in most situations by hefty, Triggerless Instant Damage tied to an Accuracy boost that's not nearly as common as Attack or Evasion for similar damage crew. Ideal at eight seconds? No, but more than adequate for those of us who like to win with our favorites.
