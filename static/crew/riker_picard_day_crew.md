“I don't know; I think the resemblance is rather striking,” is a quote attributed to this version of William T. Riker, and now we have to determine if this variant resembles a worthwhile Legendary or not.

Speaking of striking, this art invokes feelings affection; a reminder of the classic scene with Captain Picard (“I’m a role model”) and Admiral What’s-Her-Face on the conference room viewer. The doll is clearly what makes the card, and we'll verbally spar you if you say otherwise. Or not, you're entitled to your (wrong) opinions.

CPD Riker is released with a free Time Portal Giveaway and 3 more copies available via an Endurance Objective Event. So any player, new or old, can get this crew fused to 4/5 and Fully Equipped fairly easily. He’ll be a boon for many a new and novice captain with his mid-100s introductory rank on Voyages, and it’s nice that he’s avoided the trap of CMD/DIP/SUCK with a helpful SCI kicker. Also, his top two skills of SEC/DIP are undoubtedly the most useful permutation of the CMD/DIP/SEC trifecta.

Unfortunately, Riker has little to offer at this moment for the “elderly player” with only one Collection, an inferior rank on Voyages compared to to many a retrievable crew, and no Gauntlet use. His ability for Ship Battles is interesting with a big gob of Crit Bonus (+12000) and a strong 60% Uptime, so he could find some fringe use there. One day down the line we might find Riker with up to four more trait-based Collections, so if you bide your time and follow the traits, he might resemble a high-value crew eventually.
