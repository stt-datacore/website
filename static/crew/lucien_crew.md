A voyage exclusive crew from a two-parter, Lucien was an easy name to avoid until recently. His pair of expansive collections means that you should at least check the wiki to find out which dilemma options lead you to him and he could and very well may double that collection count before too long.

He clearly lacks in all other areas except for the possibility of a trait mega here and there where heâ€™ll probably be flying your thirteenth requisition shuttle. You know what they say - the Devil finds work for idle hands.
