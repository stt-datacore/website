Sinister Dwight Schultz made slightly less so by Fluffy and the copious amount of hair left on his lap - nice one, artist. Broccoli is simply a daily use workhorse with none of those fancy ship or collection frills that all the kids are chasing these days.

Reg’s “Top X’ base and voyage ranks sit firmly in the regular use section, though if you’re a regular spender, he’s not leagues ahead of the much traitier recent former Uber campaign Reno. And for that reason, you’ll have to keep an eye on when those surface level ranks start to slip as he does lack those aforementioned perks and neither Barclay nor Neelix are exactly eventable names. Regardless, he’s a fine crew overall and a nice departure from traity popsicle sticks or gauntlet crew of campaigns past.
