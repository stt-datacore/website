If you should perish in the heat of Skirmish battle, know that we here at the Big Book of Behold Advice will sing, an EPIC song, of moooooooooooooooourniiiiiiiiiiing-ah! Ahem. Now, heed me. On the face of it, Thalia may seem utterly skippable thanks to her firmly meh-diocre voyage power, but taken as a whole, she may well be an investment that could pay off in the future - and the Big Book absolutely LOVES pontificating about the future, no matter how many times we may be wrong about it.

Of her six traits, three are already collections, all of which just got weighty expansions that are going to keep you scanning retrieval optimisers and trait lists for months to come. A fourth, Royalty, is just about niche enough that it could qualify for an exclusive, very fancily dressed collection all on its own, while the hidden Pet People tag makes her borderline essential for the true crew collector, given it's the only way you can obtain Data and his endothermic quadraped, especially if you missed out on the six packers Professor Data or Keyla Terrana.

Then there's the curious timing of her debuting within two weeks of Pollux Spock from the same episode of Strange New Worlds - for those of you who don't know your history, that's the kind of crew pool seeding that eventually led to us getting the Badda Bing collection and Scapegoat O'Brien, who should, by now, speak for himself. Add in the fact that this is our first La'an variant, plus the fact that Strange New Worlds crew and WRG affections go together like sick kids and nebula aliens, and this is a crew that could pay off now, a week from now, and six months, even a year down the line, depending on what the developers have in mind for their long term strategy. 

It's also worth keeping in mind that while her power may be relatively unimpressive, she's actually top of her field for this particular skill order. If you need a little help with Costumed AM traits, or just need to scrape a little MED into your top heavy voyages, she may still find work even on well rounded rosters, to say nothing of the CMD base she's hefting around in that gown of hers. Not a crew for everyone, to be sure, but if you have even a little affection for this throwback episode, the art, the dog, the collections, or the numerous other things to like about this crew, you owe it to yourself to try and snag at least one copy.
