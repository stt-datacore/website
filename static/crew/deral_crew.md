Brett Cullen’s list of acting credits is longer than the list of players temp banned by WRG for opening packs, but surely the pinnacle of his career came when briefly romancing Jadzia Dax before shifting into an alternate universe along with his entire planet. That’s the most Star Trek plot that’s ever been penned.

Anyways, that was just some filler, much like this crew. There’s only so many times you can say, “Well, I guess he’s got a few traits.” His four viable traits will look to provide post-cryo value in the form of collections and events, but this is not a daily operator or a behold priority unless he maxes out his collection potential in a hurry.
