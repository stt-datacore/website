Portal 63 teaches us a valuable lesson; if a crew debuts with mediocre stats, they ain't going to get better. Only fifteen months removed from his release, Portal is mired in a set of poor stat ranks and quickly sinking lower. His three traits severely limit any chance to snag a stray event bonus and almost any new event reward will perform better on your roster. A four second arena activator is mildly interesting, but his poor passive stats somewhat undercut the crit bonus from his ability and can be found elsewhere in a more substantial amount.
