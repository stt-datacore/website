HE DOES EXIST! 

And, like that great-aunt who took over the family farm in Iowa you visited one summer when you were 8, Kazon Boimler collects plates. All he wanted was a simple Tom Paris autograph to complete his Voy (wow, that does actually save a ton of time) Collection. Instead, he gets yet another yawn of a card (we’re sensing a theme here, WRG). Art that evokes the desperation and fume induced madness of his quest combines with 3 stat-boosting collections to give us something worth chasing, as that’s just about all FanBoimler offers. So grab your free event copies, cite him for the Animated Collection, and stick him back in the Jeffries Tube where he belongs.
