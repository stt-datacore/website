Somewhere out there, Dougherty and Ross are doing the Spiderman pointing meme as we speak. They're not just cut from the same cloth, they cuddle up together under that cloth at night. By the way, if you're looking for the gauntlet-y one, that's Admiral Owen Paris. I know, I mix them up too.

The only tangible value here is the Diplomat collection spot. His other non-HFS traits seem less than likely to be first in line to catch their own collections, which naturally means he'll be in three by the time you're reading this. If you're tight on crew space, don't feel bad making this one of the first names you airlock - you can reel him back in later on. Dougherty out.
