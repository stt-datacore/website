Kurak's shockingly high event count is decidedly backwards-looking, even if future Klingon bonuses are a distinct possibility. Therein, her SCI base has the possibility of being thaw-worthy, but the real reason you're taking her from a behold is the dual collection spots. The Klingon tag will be of value in that context for years to come, by which time we may see an expansion of the 2018 Innovator collection. If nothing else, her Innovator trait saves you from rummaging through the super rare trash for Innovator collection-only pieces.
