Stacked up alongside the Lower Decks cadet cards, you wouldn’t notice anything different about Stupid Sexy Shaxsy, but WRG had the good sense to gauntletize a card that could have easily gotten lost in the shuffle.

It goes without saying that the CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set will hamstring a card’s voyage utility, but with the relevant (and appropriate) traits to pop dozens of elevated crit gauntlet sets, Shaxs will put his strong proficiencies to use regularly. Even if you only used him at 45% crit, that’s often enough to make him a card worth acquiring. 

There’s little value in fully fusing a card so deficient in other areas, but he does have a reasonable collection ceiling to soften the blow in future beholds and should be retrievable for quite a while.
