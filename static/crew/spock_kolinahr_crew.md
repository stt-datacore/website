Kolinahr's wheelhouse is events. His DIP base nearly doubles the next closest variant and Spock's event count includes character-wide traits like Vulcan, Musician, and Exobiology to provide a good deal of weekend work. Unfortunately, his daily usage will not match his weekend effectiveness; he's merely average for shuttles, voyages, and gauntlet.
