A disappointment wrapped in a failure packaged in a letdown. It can be hard to avoid the CMD/DIP/SEC deluge early on and Stametsâ€™ shuttle numbers do look tempting, but he should be a hard avoid for rosters of every level. Lacking usability or power in many areas, he offers only Starfleet cadet eligibility and regret in the wake of his immortalizing while you wait for the huge Romantic collection to hit.
