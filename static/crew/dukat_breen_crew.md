Itâ€™s always nice when a handsome card has the goods to backup the looks, and Breen Dukat just about does. Triple stat-boosting collections make him worth your time even if he's not strictly necessary for any of them, and his best (trait) event days may be ahead of him. Not much daily value, but unlocks a lot of potential when fully fused - not as big of a pain in the ass as Kira would have you think.
