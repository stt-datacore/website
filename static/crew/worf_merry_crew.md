There was a time around early 2018 where Big Red, post global giveaway, would actually be a frequent player in the gauntlet. Nowadays he rarely makes it out of mothballs, though he does alright in a few gauntlets if you can look past some understandable 2-skiller bias. But more consistent value has begun to blossom years after his arrival with his collection of collections.

Any of his traits could join the collection frenzy - a few already have and he boasts a vanity cherry on top. With Worf such a strong event name, even his bad bases will ride requisition shuttles and are a nice usage safety blanket if you cite him up for collection considerations. If you must keep him out of cryo for purposes of art or weird Worf fetishes, he performs like Ardra-lite in the arena, activating fast enough, but without the damage ceiling that she can provide.

Will Scarlett...a great Klingon and an even greater question.
