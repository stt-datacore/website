This holographic hero is a fair facsimile of fellow variant Augment Picard, simply trading off some base power for better voyage and gauntlet numbers. The latter of which may be his only point of entry into daily use - his metrics there won't blow anyone away, but acceptable proficiencies have a number of elevated crit gauntlets to allow him spot duty if your roster isn't yet totally stocked.

Beyond that it's the typical event/collection pairing we see more and more of from older crew. The Picard event train runs on time (unlike Deutsche Bahn. Fuck Deutsche Bahn) and the majority of his traits are still eventable enough. Those same traits show reasonable collection promise and will help keep his desirability afloat as he descends to pure (perhaps freezable) event piece.
