It’s called a dance floor – and here’s what it’s for, so come on, Vogue!

May this be the first and last time Madonna is used in reference to Star Trek: Timelines.

Who’s that Girl? It’s the best Leeta in the game, of course -   dancing into your crew quarters during a galaxy event, or sooner if you were Hung Up on trying your hand and dilithium at the new Precaps tm.  Straight from the long-desired Trill Mega, Emony is here to feel the Music, but ultimately, she will Take a Bow on her way to the vault to be Frozen.

Sharing a skillset with 8 other Super Rare cards, you’ll find her voyage use limited to younger rosters or Nightmare accounts.  The lineup of traits is a good variety – Artist, Trill, Athlete, Bajoran.  Her Antimatter bonus will probably only hit for the Bajoran trait, and that’s Like a Prayer for that to likely happen.  The same younger accounts could take advantage of a ‘free’  Super Rare crew from the event on DIP/MED shuttles, but her usefulness tapers off there, with no help in Gauntlet or Arena other than to Die Another Day. 

The best way to Express Yourself by getting Leeta is to immortalize her for her 2 stat boosting collections, with potential for 2 more.  The Athlete and Trill collections require almost all the characters to finish them, so don’t skip an opportunity to bolster your numbers if you can afford the effort.  The fantastic art is likely the only other thing that could get me to Justify My Love for this representation of an otherwise excellently acted and portrayed role by Chase Masterson.
