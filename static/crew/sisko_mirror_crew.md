Handfuls of events wasted on irredeemable bases have long left Sisko in the avoid pile. 2020, being the wacky year that it was, did finally give us a reason to behold this otherwise pathetic mess. You will need him for the Smoke and Mirrors collection for the foreseeable future, but don't bother leveling him until you're at a collection threshold or just need the crew slot.
