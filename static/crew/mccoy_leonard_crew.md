Dr. Leonard McCoy's Comparative Alien Physiology medical textbook somehow didn't earn this Bones variant the exobiology tag, which is a damn shame as it would give him an even juicier set of collections. As it stands, what he has is 'good enough' and generally worth the long voyage trek it takes to get him. Beyond that, he's merely a warm body for event shuttles, but isn't it a nice feeling to get to use a crew that took so much time and so many resources to fully fuse?
