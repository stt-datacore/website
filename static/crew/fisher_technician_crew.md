Lucky to have debuted with any semblance of usability at all, that has begun drying up for Fisher. A part time voyager with reasonable anti-matter chances, Fisher’s subpar raw power has seen him drop from use there on many rosters while almost any new crew approximating his skill set should offer better stats.

With a very tenuous link to relevance via traits, this is a card to safely avoid in beholds unless you have several stars gathered on him already.
