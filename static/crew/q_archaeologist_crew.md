Bone Digger Q (maybe needs a motorcycle with flames and some badass skull helmet) is plenty capable without a third skill and excels in the areas you expect from a 2-skiller; events and collections.

While unsurprisingly not the only costumed member of the Continuum in game, it's always advisable to grab multiple collection spots with a single crew. And a few traits which have already supplemented his event work could also hit in both areas going forward. John de Lancie's Q variants aren't overflowing with SCI options and edging out the hybrid Data Q for those seats helps make Archaeologist a worthwhile thaw candidate depending on the bonus size of his events.
