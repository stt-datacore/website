For a while, your MED options to clear Tuesday cadet nodes consisted of Phlox and Nurse Kes. Then an honor hall option was added and more recently the much stronger Ensign Tendi. With each finger that slips from the value cliff heâ€™s hanging onto, the more likely it is that only collections will be there to break his fall.

Considering his lack of tangible usage outside of your early game Tuesdays, feel free to leave him for a midgame collections leveling project if you can unlock those nodes without him.
