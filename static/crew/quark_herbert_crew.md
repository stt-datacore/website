In this house, we love and respect Armin Shimmerman - especially when this particularly Principal Synder-esque variant nets dual collections, Quark events, and a thaw-able CMD base to boot. He'd almost be useful on ships if not for a pesky attack handicap, but offers enough value otherwise for a 2-skill offering. If crew are going to be shuttle fodder, then they can only hope to offer post-fusion value like this.
