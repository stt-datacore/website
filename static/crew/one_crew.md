Two 1k bases never performed so badly. Even if you guaranteed another Borg mega, I wouldn't be willing to invest five stars of value for a crew who offers nothing day to day. A Borg faction and mini-mega early in 2019 should have piqued some interest in their future, but as a to-date performer, One simply falls flat. If you select him because of his wonderful character and episode, cross your fingers for more Borg event action.
