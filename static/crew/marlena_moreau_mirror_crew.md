Voyage-oriented super rares and 6-packs don't mix, but such is the case for Miss Marlena whose headline reads 'Ballyhooed Mintakan Troi Pipped on Voyages'.

Players still using super rares in that area of the game will find her useful if they happen across a fused version, but the cupboard isn't exactly stocked otherwise. A single collection which should double before too long looks to be the extent of her value in that area and and otherwise useful arena evasion ability carries an unfortunate attack handicap.

With some low level event possibilities hinging on two traits, Marlena is a "smoke 'em if you got 'em" type of card who should be utilized early on in your Timelines journey and then put on ice.
