A perfectly middling SEC Base, combined with one of the worst CMD Bases in the entire game, gives Reed very limited usefulness even if you are a new player. Even his 150% Instant Damage ship ability is hidden behind a position trigger. He can be replaced by many other Uncommon Crew, or if Reed is your guy keep your eye out for his far superior Rare variant: Sniper Reed.
