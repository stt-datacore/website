No one is particularly excited to see Changeling Martok, which is totally understandable, but he does have a few edges not yet smoothed, thanks to a top five gauntlet pair that's competitive against everyone not named Locutus or Gowron and dual collections. On the weekend he's amassed a formidable number of bonuses which should at least merit behold consideration against the plethora of one-hit wonders floating around.  His future value is solely baked into his traits with Undercover Operative being a very realistic and requested collection, and several other traits on the fringe of being viable.
