Sam Kirk looks really happy to be in that EV suit and to get off the ship and onto an away mission. Just don’t tell him what happens on the Deneva colony in a few years.

Debuting in a more traditional Tuesday Pack, Sammy ticks most of the boxes for a crew of his Rarity: enough Voyage power to pitch in on an early game roster, a decent Base for Events when he snags a bonus (likely Traits or a SNW Mega Event as opposed to variant), and enough Traits to have a four or five Collection ceiling one day. The Ship Ability looks interesting with Instant Damage starting at 200% but Charging up to 400%, but that’s pretty much all it is; interesting.
