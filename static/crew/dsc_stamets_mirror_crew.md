What you might call the King of the Might Have Been, Mirror Stamets used to be very highly regarded in these parts, but time and missed opportunities have worn him down. The least desirable combination of the ENG/MED/SCI skill set combine with barren traits, a sinking voyage score, and overstuffed SCI skill ranks to make him daily use crew only for those with an affection for his character or a need to justify finishing him off for his stat booster.

That being said, the #1 Mirror SCI, #3 Mirror ENG and #3 Discovery SCI base are all worth something. If you luck into him early, there are far worse crew to stash away for the future, especially since one ENG/MED crew does not a voyage make - you might well find yourself using him more than ‘better’ crew with worse skill sets until you can settle on an upgrade you feel strongly about citing.
