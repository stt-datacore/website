Well, here we are - at the point where even the artists for this game are sick of all the SCI/DIP/CMD cards we've been getting these last few months. Look at poor Riker. Look at him. No, really, look at him, you'll start to feel as queasy as he does. 

He may have stolen Chef Riker's distinction of being the only Willy with SCI, but aside from 50 or so voyage ranks between them, the one man series-wrecking ball is a better overall package than this coronavirus inspired card. 

SCI slots are likely to be harder to come by in Riker events, there are no collections to his name, and just look at some of the other, better options for this skill set we've gotten. 

If you weren't here for Surak, then chances are you were here for Tenavik. If you weren't here for Tenavik, then chances are you were here for the global gift of Mambo Picard. And if you weren't here for Mambo Picard! Then chances are very good you were here for Picard and Number One! And if you weren't here for Picard and Number One! . . . Then who's driving the plane?!
