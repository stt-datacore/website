This unjoined Ezri has been grandfathered into Dax events, but the point is usually moot with bases too weak for even requisition shuttles on most rosters. A recent Mirror collection has made her a must-have for many players and that's likely her only payoff for a build cost that gobbles up Terran Empire faction items.
