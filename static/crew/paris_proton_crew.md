He's been featured event crew four times and owns a stellar Paris event clip, but outside of that he offers little aside from an extremely torturous and expensive build. 132 basic holoprograms are needed and you'll likely be replicating multiple 5* items just to shunt him off to stasis. Youâ€™ll want him eventually for those event features and perhaps his vanity collection, but make sure your inventory can take the hit of his build cost before using behold capital on him.
