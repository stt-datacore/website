The Organians seem to think so, but it is perhaps the rest of the galaxy's dissent with that idea that will unite it.","rules":"-- This is an Anomaly Event! The following rule changes will apply:\n1. Mission start cost is tripled.\n2. Mission instant complete cost is doubled.\n3. Crew cooldown after completing a mission is halved.\n4. Bonus progress on the Main Mission is doubled.\n5. Bonus reward amounts for the Main Mission completion are doubled, higher chance to receive Crew Revival Tokens.\n6. New Main Mission completion rewards added: 4-star Honorable Citation, 5-star Honorable Citation.\n7. 5x Victory Points earned for completing Specialist Missions, 2x Victory Points earned for completing the Main Mission.  \n-- In a Specialist Event, you will select crew to engage in Specialist Missions.\n-- Only a single crew with corresponding skills can be assigned to a Specialist Mission. After the mission is completed, that crew will be disabled from doing Specialist Missions for some period of time.\n-- Specialist Missions take time to complete. The higher selected crew skills are the less time it will take them to complete a mission.\n-- Only the highest skill of a crew is considered when calculating time to complete a mission.\n-- Using crew with matching Specialist Mission bonus traits will significantly decrease time needed to complete a mission.\n-- Each time a Specialist Mission is completed, some progress is also gained on the Main Mission. Completing the Main Mission rewards substantial amounts of Event Victory Points.\n-- Using Ayelborne, any version of Vina, Pike, The Keeper, or Cosmic crew will provide a chance to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission.\n-- When you fail to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission using featured crew or crew with matching event bonus traits, the bonus progress chance goes up slightly the next time you use such crew in a mission. If you score the bonus progress, the bonus chance amount goes back to its initial value. \n-- Community Rewards are also available during Phase 1 only. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock these rewards before the phase change!\n-- You earn Event Victory Points each time you complete a Specialist Mission or the Main Mission. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Ayelborne, Vina, Pike, The Keeper, or Cosmic","rewards_teaser":"Reach Rank 1 by gaining Victory Points from Specialist Missions!","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":28896,"symbol":"crusher_j_counselor_crew","name":"Jack","full_name":"Counselor Jack Crusher","flavor":"Jack Crusher was able to find his way after all.
