You'd think 'The Father of the Transporter' would be a more remarkable crew in Timelines. After all, Commander Trip "Charles" Tucker used to read his biography as a boy.

As he stands, no pun intended, Emory isn't much more than a voyager. As a former campaign crew, a lot of players were probably able to realize that potential with four stars available in one go. If you’re looking at a ground floor investment, however, factor in the amount of time it would take to immortalize Del Paxton and if he’d still be useful in that area by the time you get there.

Blunted bases aren't a huge concern given his lack of consistent event work and the low Faction ratio provided by living mega to mega, but his stat distribution doesn't translate into enough proficiency for much gauntlet play beyond the early game either. Emory could voyage for a while on some rosters, but with so few peripheral perks, you'll need to star him up early on to utilize him on voyages while you still can.
