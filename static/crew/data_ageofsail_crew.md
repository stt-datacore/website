A nice change of pace from all the ENG primary Datas, AoS leverages a variant-best CMD for fairly regular event work. His smattering of traits and a new Picard-themed TV show should help him rebound from a slow 2019. A chunk of arena damage always catches the eye, but the unfortunate combination of trigger and poor passive stats brings him in a hair behind more available options like Covert Leland or Survivalist Kirk. It certainly doesn't help that even if you snagged him at 4/5 from a campaign, you might find his daily use numbers too unappealing to finish him off unless you really, really want that Age of Sail collection finished.
