A "blue moon" voyager, Burnmom's smattering of traits and fairly uncommon skill order will earn her the occasional voyage seat, but pathetic debut metrics means the fuse is running on her shelf life and it's about to blow.

Those same traits (and Discovery) have afforded her a few event bonuses over the years and may pan out for a collection or two - until then she remains a total crapshoot and needed more juice in her stats to overcome an uncertain future.
