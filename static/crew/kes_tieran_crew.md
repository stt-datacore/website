WRG has long been inconsistent with stat creep. In one area they may blow the roof of and in others crew can coast for years atop the rankings. So it is with Kes who has enjoyed years as the top super rare CMD base and may hold that spot for years more. Without 'bridge crew' status, that may not seem the most lucrative metric to dominate in, but the game is in a different place now.

Kes' fascinating trait set has more or less been a dud as of this writing, but with a floor of, well, the floor and a ceiling of six+ collections and multi-mega shuttle dominatrix, Warlord Kes is one of the best low-cost dice rolls you can take.
