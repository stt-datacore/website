A good-not-great MED proficiency roll is far less useful than it appears - try fighting with one arm tied behind your back. Her collection doesn't require all the super rare crew (let alone any legendaries) to complete. Her arena evasion might be usable if you can overcome the accuracy handicap, but there are fistfuls of crew who can do the same job without it.
