"Saru-Man, Saru-Man, does whatever a Saru can! Need advice? He's your pal! Like he did, for Su'Kal -- look out, here comes the Saru-Man!"

Ahem. So, for those Doug Jones fans who wondered about the man behind the makeup, here he is! And what a solid addition he could make for your Timelines lineup. Debuting with a top five voyage score (just a week after similar standout Reunion Spock and Kirk) and DIP base, those alone are strong reasons to acquire him. But he also contributes to both the Costumed and Exobiology collections, ensuring he'll have lasting value in that area for years.

Likewise he checks in with a suitably long trait list, providing antimatter bonuses and event prospects beyond his Saru variant status. Shame he couldn't also snag Musician, because...

"To him, life's a great big holodeck / Wherever there's a shipwreck / You'll find the Saru-Man!"
