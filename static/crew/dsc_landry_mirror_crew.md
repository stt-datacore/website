Waking up with a fat stack of past event bonuses is pretty nice for someone with so little screen time. Her SEC sits at #2 among Disco crew, #3 for the Mirror Universe, and is fairly dependent on those bonuses for relevance. If there's a discernible end to the torrent of all-Disco events then Landry and several other crew will plummet in desirability. Until that happens, she sits on a dynamite keg of event potential. She's a fine Faction piece acquisition, but a risky investment.
