Before the likes of Braxton and EV Picard, the CMD/ENG ranks of the Gauntlet were the Super Rares’ playground. You can see the remnants of that if you take Tucker with his 45% Gauntlet and wait for the Skills to line up just right, though doing so is not a recommended exercise past the beginning stages of your roster.

A few yearly Events might trigger a thaw for Charles, but you're most likely after him for Collections. He's probably at his maximum potential there, and fortunate to have grabbed two from hidden Traits (evsuit and ent) but that doesn’t mean he’s not a solid choice in a Super Rare Behold.
