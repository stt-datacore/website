The folks behind the #NotMyNana movement would agree that her likeness here is rather sketchy, but you might want to hold your nose (sorry) and bear it anyways. 

Veteran players will love the collection value (including the massive Resourceful and Costumed groups) and prodigious event count that plays very nicely with big base metrics to make her one of the first names to thaw on the weekend,

But long before newer players get to that point, they’ll enjoy Hippie’s big voyage power and workman-like shuttle performance. The power knob was curiously cranked up for this bit of comedic relief in an otherwise heavy two-parter, but we’ll happily accept her anyways.
