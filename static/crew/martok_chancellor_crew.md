Martok and a fiver might get you a delicious chicken sandwich, but unbeknownst to most is that Martok has hit on at least one event bonus in five of six calendar years. With a half dozen other eventable traits, he a lesser known name who might end up driving your shuttles more often than you'd expect.

With middling voyage power and a dire skill set, the other point of interest is his trio of collections, headlined by Klingon. With legendary crew still relevant for two of them and Veteran overripe for expansion, Chancellor Martok is a fine name to behold or even toss a few stars on to tackle multiple areas of your roster at once.
