Deanna de Vil, Deanna de Vil, if she can’t have Alkar, then nobody will. We're not in the habit of turning away CMD/MED or SEC/MED voyagers, and Troi is one of only a handful of legendaries to contribute to both, making her unique enough to separate her from the pack of SEC/CMDs that surround her in the ranks. 

Troi's event count has cooled after a torrid 2017/18 pace, but that can change at a moment's notice and the Bride of Alkar-stein has the right SEC/CMD skill set for easy shuttle seating. Newer players may find use for her in the Gauntlet when she hits on a 45% crit trait match considering the total lack of MED + CMD/SEC walls, but her proficiencies don't hold up on late game rosters.

P.S. to one J.P. Hubbell - nice work, Ensign. Hope it's not too rough scrubbing down plasma manifolds for the rest of your tour on board.
