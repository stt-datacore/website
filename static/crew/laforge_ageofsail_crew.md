The ENG/CMD pair may still be plus value on voyages at the legendary level, but Geordi's voyage power is low enough that it won't take much effort to wean him off your runs in the mid-game. And though he faces no super rare competition for ENG shuttles in La Forge events, his Faction rate sits around a paltry 30% - a number that is likely to rise without Expeditions a factor. Long term value in the form of a strong event clip and triple collections makes him worth the behold capital, even if you don't use him day to day.
