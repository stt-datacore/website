If I had a nickel for every 1-Skill ENG crew in the game I’d have a much bigger handful of change than you’d expect, which is kinda cool in a sad way. Speaking of sad things, here’s Ensign Kim! The long-awaited Musician collection has maxed out his traits and therefore his usefulness. Much like Captain Janeway, we here at the Big Book aren’t promoting this crew any time soon.
