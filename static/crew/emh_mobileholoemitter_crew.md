The former MED base leader has officially fallen from the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. You’d have a hard time finding a redder scorecard, but the fly in the ointment here is his fusion ability. Combining with a super rare Indignant Seven card creates Indulgent Seven, a fairly worthy card - certainly worthier than her component elements. 

Considering Mobile Doctor cannot be isolated in crew retrieval, you’d better grab his first star whenever possible if you have designs on acquiring and immortalizing the iconic Cheesecake Seven.
