SEC/SCI is notoriously hard to come by for voyages and despite a sinking voyage total, Klingway (No? We'll work on it…) remains a top five option. Still holding strong is her base SEC. Even with an event count that slowed to a glacial crawl in 2018, Janeway + Klingon will give her plenty of future chances to shine where her SEC and SCI are both #1 or 2 among all Janeways and Klingons.
