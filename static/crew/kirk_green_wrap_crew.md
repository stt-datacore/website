Really DB should be making Kirk, Picard and all the main crew into stars in this game, but...no. Just-Threw-On-A-Towel Kirk has the worst CMD primary stat for a 3* card, even being beaten by some 2* crew. He's not available for cadet missions and his ship ability is fairly terrible. His Inspiring trait makes the collection and being a main cast member means you could possibly use him in an event or two, but don't rely on him for daily use if you have better crew.
