Offering something for everyone, Mariner’s Mom has this author doing the Fry squint at her final tier score. Great front-loaded collection value makes her a must have for elderly players, while requisite daily power on voyages and shuttles make her a fine early game event acquisition for desperate newer rosters.

With Vindicta Mariner turning the ship battle world on its head, it’s worth noting that Freeman’s +9 attack boost has the same initialization time and subsequent activations. They would make a fun pair to ride together as she has the same cycle as her daughter. Please don’t use the previous sentence in any other context ever ever ever ever.
