Communications officers from TOS onwards that are not Uhura or Sato tend to get a bit neglected when it comes to Trek appearances and...oh wait, that's Bryce. This is Rhys. I'm getting my ‘yce’s confused again.

Dual wielded programmable matter ray guns are not enough to dissuade us that the winter of bad crew is upon us again and WRG are now steering us into the snowdrift of adequacy. Rhys is a card you need to think carefully about as to whether you need him or not.

He doesn’t quite have the power to play amongst the other crew in his area of expertise. Debuting near voyage rank 200 isn’t a complete crime, especially if you missed out on EV Suit Spock in last year's mega or somehow can’t find the ISM cash to retrieve Tactical Stamets or Leucon. Yet there is just enough utility to see him aboard a twelve hour voyage with enough RNG luck, but a slim picking of traits means he’s easily beaten on most modern calculators by a plethora of better traited crew.

Over time we might be blessed with dozens of Rhys events that are over abundant with SEC shuttle seats but my magic eight ball has broken so the only advice I can give you is “Don’t bet on it”.
