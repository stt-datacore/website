Commandant Reaction-Shot was lucky to catch a good ship ability, considering this pilot's lack of the pilot trait - and a lot of other useful ones, really. Detmer does have the perfect skill set for shuttle seating, but with the amount of exposition Discovery affords most of its bridge crew, her shot at weekend work is almost all Mirror-driven. If your arena lineup isn't set in stone yet, Keyla's first star might save you a retrieval, but beyond that she's merely bottom barrel behold fodder.
