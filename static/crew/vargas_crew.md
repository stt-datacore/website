He may hate chili powder, but how else is Tuco going to stay warm through those frosty nights on AR-558? A pair of 1100+ bases could make a splash if he gets lucky (Hero/Veteran), but with a handful of bloated or generic traits, Vargas is best left as an episode-driven collector's piece. Hefty arena attack represents a shred of value elsewhere, though most space battles involving the Krayton are over before he can activate.
