The comparison to Temporal Prisoner Chakotay is apt, even if it's low hanging fruit. No one has laughed about Chuckles' voyage prowess over the last two years, but as his power is in its twilight, we're offered a version with refreshed stats across the board (though it's hard to beat TPC's 10 MED proficiency).

Not having sat on the bridge before, it might be easy to dismiss Ba'ul as a voyager only, but Discovery has dragged far less potent crew to relevance and 2019 gave Disco qualifiers more chances to man Faction shuttles than Chakotay has had in the game's four year run. As long as the Discovery juggernaut continues to run rampant, Ba'ul's two top five Disco bases will put in some serious work.

On ships, his 400% boomstick may be helpful to many players despite a cloak trigger, thanks to the portal introduction of the Valdore and its inclusion as the December arena reward. A notable weakness, Ba'ul's traits, slightly dampen his voyage and event potential, but the justifiably ballyhooed Discovery trait and pristine skill set keep this crew in rarefied air and allow him to contribute from multiple angles.
