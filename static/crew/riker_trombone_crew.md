🎵When the jazzman's testifyin'
A faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise
Or bring you to your knees🎵

There’s two things Riker loves: Boning, and ‘Boning. If he’s not doing either of those, he’s probably helping a newer player out during Events with his solid CMD Base and highly eventable traits (which also add Collection value). He’ll stick around on your roster longer than other Rares will thanks to a mighty +7 Attack bonus in Ship Battles. Just don’t ask him to play Nightbird.
