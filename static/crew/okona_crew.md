An affable rogue, it makes sense that Chadiun Okona is a dice roller. Lacking any 45%+ gauntlet sets and competing against The Red Angel are strikes one and two against his viability, but he can leverage a pair of reasonably sized rolls to pick up a few wins, particularly for newer rosters. He owns the top ENG/DIP roll in a number of his 25% gauntlets and the aforementioned exclusive crew is the only consistent competition he's likely to face in that skill pair.

Aside from that, his handful of non-HFS traits should continue to present unexpected event and collection opportunities here and there, assuming you can keep him away from your female crew members.
