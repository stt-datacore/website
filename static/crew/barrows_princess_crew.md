See Palamas, Grecian Carolyn for Barrows’ art contemporary. Surely there will be more than a few bridge crews adorned with these lovely dresses. Tonia debuts with very similar usability as well - just about as much as you should hope for in a one-off.

Punching slightly above her raw voyage score thanks to a plus skill set and strong anti-matter seating, Tonia slots in with a tidy two-to-three year voyage profile for the average roster. With shuttle metrics of a similar sort, she’ll have no problem piloting your 99% failboats during those rare weekends she has an event bonus.

There are no standout metrics to make a mad dash for, but Barrows’ utility in several areas makes her a fine affection choice and multi-year contributor for many players.
