Once a mega, always a mega? If you’re still mulling a cite on this 4/5 recurring crew from half a decade ago, you probably need more help than this column can offer. But if you’re coming to Kortar fresh, he’s exactly what he looks like - just a guy.

His worthwhile trait set will drive almost all of his value; providing a strong collection portfolio and all of his event opportunities. While his bases have long since retired from daily service, they’re the right skill set for easy shuttle seating and some Faction Action on any weekend where he snags a bonus.
