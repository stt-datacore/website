You weren't the only one who had to look up this crew on Memory Alpha, so let's start out with an easy crew comp to the equally impure Klingon Neelix. They have matching SEC scores and rely on a smattering of traits for thawpertunities, but Laneth's 'saboteur' and 'villain' both seem fairly juicy, while her smooth forehead fortuitously sneaks her into the Engineered collection.

Speaking of, a trio of collections is shockingly strong value for someone you may have never heard of and even if you're only eyeballing her for whittling away at the massive Klingon collection, the other two (particularly Veteran) could be expanded at a moment's notice. If you missed her Tuesday inclusion and have forgotten this crew exists by the time she's added to the portal, your best bet is to take the collection value if the other behold options don't blow you away.
