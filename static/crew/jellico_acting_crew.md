Sporting stats that would have made him merely okay crew this time last year, Jellico is a classic example of all base, no trousers. Let's run it down, shall we? A duo of events, unlikely to be duplicated, originating from his Acting Captaincy, and almost completely uneventable traits. A voyage score surrounded by superior bases and bridge crew with quintuple the event count, coupled with a real stinker of a skill set. The only things that are even remotely attractive are a strong (but sliding) CMD base, his newly relevant collection where his stats are at least passable amongst the 'and the rest crowd,' and a measly 300% instant damage ability. On a 12 second timer. With a Position trigger. Localised entirely within your space kitchen.

Can I see it working out? No. In his episode, Jellico told others to get it done, and regardless of your feelings about him, they got it done. But if you're looking for a card to get it done, this ain't it, chief.
