Chancellor Gurken might put you in a behold pickle, but not for the usual reasons. His two strongest advocates are ironically an awful retrieval chance and the retread CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set which excels for shuttle seating. Bereft of power outside of ship ability, Gorkon could easily go years between uses, but he at least should end up with a quartet of collections which you may lose access to if he’s skipped in a behold. But don’t lose any sleep over it if you do.
