Reserved Plakson is a rare Pepe indeed, but while most of Selar’s offerings are modest, she’s still a worthy option in a couple areas. Boasting full weekend eligibility and a huge combined MED score, she’s a fine choice to help crit lots of cadet and galaxy map missions. Her build cost is relatively light on faction items and thanks to her huge proficiency, you may not need to fully fuse her to get most of that benefit.

Even as a one skill crew, you may bring her to a few gauntlets early on if she has elevated crit values, but that’s more of a side benefit for a crew who knocks out nodes like a natural.
