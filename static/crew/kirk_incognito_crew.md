With the best bases of the 4* Kirks, you'd think there would be more to recommend this handsome chap, but with a vanilla skill set, a merely serviceable ship ability and traits that don't go very far, he seems appropriately inconspicuous. Almost as if that's what he wants you to think. Where this nondescript gentleman's strengths lie become more obvious when you take a look at his +1 Inspiring, and the fact that 9 of the 10 Kirk events have been Faction based. The #4 base CMD suddenly looks indispensable when you're looking for ready, willing and able shuttle pilots. Perhaps not crew for daily use, but handy for those who haven't cleared a tricky node, and definitely a keeper for the long haul.
