She’s not the classic T’Pau we need, but because of ongoing rights issues, she’s the T’Pau we deserve right now. The Raider of the Lost Kir’Shara does alright as a starter-type crew thanks to ability on voyages, shuttles, and in the arena. With position ships like the Shenzhou available in Dabo, T’Pau’s +10 attack at eight seconds become more usable and can make her a worthwhile Arena/Skirmish asset for newer players.

While base and voyage numbers fall off faster at the super rare level than with golds, T'Pau has enough juice there to find a few months' work for Young rosters that can fuse her early. And if not, Vulcan and a couple other collectable traits should soften the blow down the line.
