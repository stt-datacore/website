Jaris' claim to fame, aside from being Piglet's boss, is the arena. The accuracy version of Killy or Kes, Jaris metes out punishment to your enemies at six seconds and can replace other staples like Ardra if you wish to freeze them instead.

It's quickly downhill outside of ships, however. A painfully thin trait set has produced some collection value, but that obviously has a limit as does his opportunity for weekend bonuses. He's frankly forgettable without that arena hammer, but if you need to wield one, he's a worthwhile investment.
