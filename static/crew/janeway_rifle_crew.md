Marine Janeway here is so very nearly a great card. She has the #3 CMD base but not a great deal of proficiency bonuses and her ship ability is a plain +5 Attack. Her voyaging score isn't the best but her primary use will be for CMD nodes on Saturday cadet missions. Once they are taken care of feel free to freeze or throw as required.
