It's rarely clearer than in a case like this where one can definitively say that a crew has peaked. Georgie will never recapture the voyage power that once upon a time offset her skill set, Discovery events are frozen in carbonite, and she has no more untapped traits for future collections.

That being said, she's still viable as a collection target and occasional thaw. Georgiou chugs along with a modest event clip while Inspiring and Diplomat have at least some amount of event potential moving forward.
