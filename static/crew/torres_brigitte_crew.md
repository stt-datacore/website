'Great Gams Torres' may not have made it past WRG's censors, but we regrettably have less filter here. A fairly nondescript 3/4 from events in the middle of 2020 struck gold just a few, short months later as she picked up double collections, both of which are massive and require fistfuls of legendary crew to complete. She's an automatic, must-pick behold option for veteran players looking to stack skill boosts, but Bump'lanna has something for everyone.

Her respectable DIP base is one of painfully few options among B'Elanna's variants (who'd have guessed?) and even sits atop the non-gold options for Klingon crew too. Between her fairly generous trait set for weekend bonus chances and a strong, if vanilla presence on voyages, there's a wealth of value here along with an outside chance at a Killing Game vanity.
