With EV Suit Worf having finally broken the logjam of CMD/DIP/SEC Worves in an appropriately dramatic fashion, it's easy to dismiss Age of Sail Worf on a superficial scan, but as the man himself would say, the true test of a warrior is not without, it is within. And within this charmingly sized Klingon (seriously, put him on your bridge crew and see how he stacks up), there's value to unpack. The #1 Worf and Klingon SEC is nothing to sniff at, especially since it translates into one of the top ten SEC bases in the game, meaning plenty of non-bonus event and daily shuttle work. 

It's also true that while the skill set is undoubtedly vanilla, it's at station keeping with a good number of Worf's contemporaries, including campaign darling High Roller Sisko, his more commanding big brother Governor Worf, and Honor Hall luminary Kahless the Unforgettable. 'Usable every so often' is somewhat of a high bar the bulk of legendary crew in the bigger collections, so Worf's double inclusion in the massive Klingon and Costumed collections (not to mention vanity), makes him a no-brainer to finish *before* you start scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Oh, and one last thing before you go - it's retract plank, not REMOVE plank.
