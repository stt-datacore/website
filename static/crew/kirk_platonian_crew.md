His build is on the tricky side; requiring a dozen 4* components and myriad faction items, but he eventually pays it off through Kirk events, a couple eventable traits, and a spot in the Inspiring collection. Strong +Acc/Crit Bonus arena ability at six seconds makes him Ardra lite there, if you haven't come across her yet. No notable bases, especially among the CMD/DIP/SEC set, but voyage numbers on the borderline of top 1/3rd might find use on younger rosters if you happen across several copies of him early.
