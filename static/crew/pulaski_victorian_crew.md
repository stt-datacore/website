For a time, Pulaski was rubbing elbows with Legendary crew and owned the top base among all Super Rare options. But despite whatever reputation she may have cultivated with an admittedly impressive run as top DIP base, she’s a poor card in modern Timelines.

Stat boosts have pushed veteran players’ shuttles right up against the hard success cap and Pulaski is below average everywhere else. She’ll certainly be worth a thaw once or twice a year with an event bonus, but is hardly a top behold choice any longer.
