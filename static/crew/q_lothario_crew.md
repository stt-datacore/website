For some players, Q Hefner’s usability may be as questionable as his choice in evening wear. There are no green lights in any one area for Q, but he at least touches upon several areas and would be an attractive crew if only the raw power meter was bumped up a bit.

Gauntlet is his highlight, at least for the moment. Q’s proficiencies are generally best suited for newer players, but a strong skill set and a few punchy trait sets offer the occasional trip to your starting five even for veteran rosters.

Only afforded a brief stay in voyage-able territory by his mediocre release power there, the other attributes likely to stick around for some time are a viable event tally roughly split between trait and variant events and an above average collection profile also fueled by those aforementioned traits. A relative jack of all trades, Q should work out alright as a low end behold option for years to come.
