In an alternate universe where Mirror 'David Duchovny' Reed exists and Chekov is mind-slapping Kirk with his own hand, there lives Platonian Cheekoof. It’s hard to imagine a less eventable lineup of traits and Chekov himself has never had grand event ambitions, so be prepared for long stretches of weekend irrelevance.

Having debuted in the 50s rankwise on voyages (take note, cite-drunk players), Chekov has already nearly ousted himself in that area of the game too, even considering that SEC/SCI stack which was coveted in the early years of the game.

‘Below average’ is the phrase du jour here. Chekov debuted with a reasonable profile, but nothing broke right for him (including some petty WRG ratfuckery) and is now merely a low end behold consolation prize.
