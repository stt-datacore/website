Nomad coordinate! Oops, wrong episode. Well, equally iconic to the Original Series faithful is the suppository-looking Nomad. This probe's Ã¼ber sophisticated tech doesn't quite translate in game, but it's still sufficiently powerful for daily use. For the fourth consecutive month, we're introduced to another top ten SCI base; this one without much of an event pedigree. But an interesting cocktail of traits should enhance Nomad's voyage seating and, if you cross your fingers hard enough, event chances down the line.

No longer the top voyager in the SEC/ENG/SCI set, Nomad is still a plug-and-play crew for anyone chasing their childhood memories, thanks to a mysterious absence of really, actually good ENG/SCI voyagers in the upper echelons of voyager crew. Though a crew's usability often slips more rapidly without regular events or broader utility, Nomad is in line to serve man for at least a while.
