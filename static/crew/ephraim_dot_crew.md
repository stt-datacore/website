The adorable 'super warp highway' traveling mama makes sense as a primarily voyage-based option. Accurate-but-niche traits don't pump up the collection/event/anti-matter triad as much as you'd hope for in a crew. Meaning that despite the strong Resourceful collection spot they debut with, E&D don't profile as a crew who has much wiggle room for improving in value over time. A fine day one voyager, you'll want to either invest early for their two to three year-ish voyage profile or take them as a 'some day' collection project.
