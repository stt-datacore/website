A steadfast, dutiful wife who embodies the old axiom of “Stand By Your Man”, Perrin loved Sarek even more than she disliked Spock. So, maybe she doesn’t embody that other axiom, “Family”. Dom Toretto in shambles…

Another thing she embodies is a Nightmare Mode™ player’s Voyaging dream! Those slightly sadistic players can rejoice at her ability to slot in to many seats and bring some sweet, sweet MED with her. Even new, “normal” players can get some use out of her once Immortalized while waiting for more powerful Legendary options to trickle into their rosters. To top it all off she brings Three Stat-Boosting Collections (including some giant ones), with the potential for a couple more, so players of all types should be happy to see her in their roster or Cryo Vault.
