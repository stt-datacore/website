"'To the pain' means the first thing you will lose will be your Dilithium crystals, below the ankles. Then your LTOs at the wrists. Next, your crew slot space."
"And then any hope of a unique skill set, I suppose. WRG killed your dreams of obtaining a gold from a Tuesday pack too quickly last time. A mistake they doesn't mean to duplicate tonight."
"I wasn't finished. The next thing you will lose will be your motivation to complete collections, the Originals followed by the stat boosters."
"And then my ship line-up will stagnate because of the card's limitless instant damage, I understand, let's get on with it!"
"WRONG! Your ship line-up you may find unlikely to change, and I'll tell you why. So that every shriek of every child at seeing your need of a Boarding trigger will be yours to cherish. Every babe that weeps at your immense voyage power, every woman who cries out, 'Dear God! What is that gorgeous avatar?!' will echo in your roster. That is what 'to the pain' means. It means the Dread Pirate Q leaves you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery, forever, outside of your reach. Until he hits the portal, anyway."
