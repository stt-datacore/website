As her art might hint at, there's far more to this Kira than meets the eye. A jewel back in 2017, the Intendant's numbers no longer flatter her, but plus versatility (gauntlet, events, collections) help make her a nice chess piece to have, even if she needs more stars than the average legendary. A handful of juicy racial traits pair with a rock solid Kira event history to produce a persuasive argument to make her one of the golds you immortalize for the Mirror and Klingon collections, even if we'd rather do that through beholds than citations.
