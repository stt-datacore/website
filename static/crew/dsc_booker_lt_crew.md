Lt. ‘Book’ Booker, a distant relative of ours, finally got justice with a post-release addition of the hidden nonhuman trait to give him some weekend cadet eligibility. Which is nice, because if he wasn’t on your early game shuttles, he wasn’t doing much.

His small-enough-to-be-collection traits should trickle out of the “potential” category single file over time, but until they do, we’re not seeing broad enough value for him to be a recommended immortalization early on over more versatile crew.
