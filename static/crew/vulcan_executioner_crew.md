Fantastic chest art (that phrase is now Big Book canon), but really Executioner is one step up from filler card. His SEC is surprisingly not the top for Vulcans (Warship Tuvok), but still plenty strong for their events. What may earn him a spot on your roster is 400% arena damage at 8 seconds without a requirement. Hitting his +9 attack there may be a pipe dream because of the stars required, but is a solid Skirmish option nonetheless.
