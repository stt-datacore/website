Whether you need a coaxial cable or a fiber optic, Electrician La Forge has something for everyone. La Forge's run as the premier DIP/ENG voyager may be a faded memory, but he’s still a competitive option there thanks to fantastic anti-matter traits and a useful skill set.

Geordi's event history is a bit murky, with a big chunk of his bonuses having come in Expedition and Skirmish endeavors. We'll still gladly snatch up his event tally, just keep that poor faction ratio in the back of your mind.

The Red Angel has broken the hearts of dozens of DIP/ENG options and Geordi’s proficiency numbers aren't necessarily eye catching, but his 45% gauntlets keep him in play and he’s a fine stopgap for newer players who find themselves regrettably Angel-less. One of the crew from 2018 to have held up the best, Interfaced is still worth the behold capital in many cases.
