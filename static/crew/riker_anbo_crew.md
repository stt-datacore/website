The Ultimate Evolution in looking goofy is an insta-freeze after he helps with a tricky node unlock, but Anbo offers at least some additional value. The Riker name brand and a slew of traits pair pretty well with the most common "and" seat on event shuttles to earn him a couple of thaws each year. And while Pilot is the only of his traits to see significant action so far, he has several of them that combine to produce a high likelihood of future collection and event bonus bumps down the line.
