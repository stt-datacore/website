As far as crew holding drinks, BR Dax (not Baskin Robbins Dax unfortunately) is among the best. As far as crew who are useful, Dax is below average these days. Jadzia has the Event pedigree which has waxed and waned as the game has waxed and waned, and her Trait set is thinner than most of her cousins. A trio of Collections is likely all she’ll get, and as it stands you need nearly all Trill to complete her racial set, so perhaps consider her as a Hail Mary Legendary Behold choice over the Ensign Sylvia Tillys of the game.
