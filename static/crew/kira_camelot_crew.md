There are a couple avenues for Guinevere to excel; as the #1 Kira SEC, the #2 Bajoran SEC, a big proficiency roll, or perhaps as a skirmish piece. But each perk has a downside. That Bajoran trait has popped up on the weekend just twice, her arena damage has a Position trigger, and her gauntlet pair isn't good enough to be ranked. Her bases are just high enough to be great when bonus, but not good enough the rest of the time. If you don't have use for her on ship battles, she's just a bit player waiting for her event number to be called.
