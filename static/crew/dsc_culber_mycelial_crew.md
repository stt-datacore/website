A card so useful you’ll think that you’re tripping on mycelium! Culber combines monster voyage potential with Disco event work and splashes of gauntlet usefulness. If you find yourself having trouble pumping up your MED/CMD voyages [literally everyone], Hugh is a hard card to pass up.

The top voyage medic is a huge piece in the quest to churn out consistently long runs for a skill that offers few elite names. And while his gauntlet stats are not as grand as the big hitters in the field, his trait combinations should match up once in a while to wield a scalpel to the proficiency jugular. Citation worthy, interesting art...an all round fun-guy!
