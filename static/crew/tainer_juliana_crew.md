What you see is what you get with Tainer. No waiting around for an event to give her relevance every six months or a 1/25th share in a collection. She's simply a great crew in every phase of daily use and a name who will come up all the time. This wouldn't be the Big (long ass) Book if we didn't mention that she has qualified for three events previously and her bases among Android crew would be exceptional for events, but that's more of a pipe dream, even considering everybody's fondness for Data.

Following the trail of stat breadcrumbs; Shuttles - strong. Better than everybody's Surak or da Vinci. Voyages - Elite. SCI/MED isn't brimming with options even after a couple high profile 2019 additions and Tainer's voyage rank has barely budged since her inception. In the land of coin flips, Tainer leverages two top 20 rolls and a top 20 proficiency total into two ranked gauntlet pairs. It's a shame she can't claim a huge single roll or better trait combinations, but is overall more than serviceable and a fine rotational piece to help complete her as a top shelf daily use option.
