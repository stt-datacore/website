The only legendary Voyager first officer who’s still usable on rosters may not be for much longer. Ready to drop into the double digit ranks for his skill set on voyages, his overall ability there is more of an indictment of his redundant skill set and thin anti-matter traits than anything to do with a power level that would play with better supporting elements.

Receiving very little event love from WRG and lacking much of a collection ceiling, there’s no cushiony fallback for Chakotay when he stops making voyages and is best approached by players who somehow aren’t swimming in the skill set or have an affection for treasonous, out-of-touch, character-undermining episode arcs.
