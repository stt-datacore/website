Tempted was ironically the Soong prototype for all the ENG primary Datas that have come after him. In his heyday he was special and even though Father Time is undefeated, Tempted still has some juice in his legs yet. Due to the logjam among Datas in the ENG base ranks, Tempted will perform similarly to other variants for his numerous events. Don't let his voyage rank scare you too much, ENG/DIP has relatively few choices and his useful skill set also helps him maintain two mid-tier ranked gauntlet pairs. As well rounded as the day he was activated, just with a notch or three less power relative to the field.
