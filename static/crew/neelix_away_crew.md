Another disappointing Neelix. Whilst he has thrown away the chef's hat for some all-terrain gear his stats are not exactly inspiring enough to consider him for daily use. His only redeeming features are the large amount of traits and a quick 150% instant damage with his ship ability. Collect him to fill out your uncommon collection but don't keep him hanging about too long, you might just end up with a bowl of leola root stew!
