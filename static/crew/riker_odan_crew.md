Gastrointestinal Distress Riker comes to us from the first sighting of the Trill onscreen, and while he doesn’t have Jadzia’s pretty spots, which notedly go all the way down, he does have a solid set of Traits for this card-collecting game we play.

His Voyage power long gone along with the original Trill makeup, Riker has managed to parlay his Trait list into a duo of Collections for now, and if he can make room for it after visiting the sonic potty (they have sonic showers, why not sonic potties?) you could see up to three more later. 

SCI seats on Shuttles aren’t frequent, but he’s got well and away the largest Riker Base in that Skill, and among the top DIP Bases so when his Event card is called, ask him to dance.
