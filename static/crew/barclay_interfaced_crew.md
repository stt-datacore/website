There's a Broccoli/vegetable joke somewhere in here… For a 2016 crew, it's nice to see Reg with a bit of usability still. He won't pop up on the weekends very often, but can still maneuver on thrusters and already lays claim to three Collections, but that is probably it.

His best and maybe only shot at usage day-to-day comes in the Gauntlet. A quartet of 45% Crit sets and less common Skill set should give him plenty of 2-for-1 opportunities and makes him a fantastic stepping stone and/or rotational piece in the land of dice rolls
