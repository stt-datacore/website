Something of a man for all seasons, Martok offers voyage, shuttle, collection, and arena value in varying degrees. A competitive SECondary and handful of galaxy map node unlocks should earn him at least some level of work on fresh rosters.

Only eligible for Tuesday cadets and requiring a smattering of Klingon and KCA faction items, it’s understandable if you’d rather save your precious trainers for other crew, though he’s not an objectively poor choice for early immortalization.
