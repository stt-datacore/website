You’d be confident too if you had as many abs as Wilson Cruz. Goddamn, dude, leave some for the rest of us. Oh, Confidant…my bad. As the filthy casuals go off to google “wilson cruise topless”, let’s break down the rest of this crew. Imagine if Dr. Hugh Culber had a third skill. That’s it. That’s the card.

The middle layer of honey-roasted DIP should help with shuttle seating for Culber’s scant event chances post-Disco megas, but it’s his voyage potential that really gets kicked up a notch. We’ve highlighted MED/DIP/SCI in other spots for its commonality and that’s true in general, but Culber’s superb anti-matter chances and MED-led skill order should still have him punching above a respectable day one raw voyage score.

Frankly subpar in most other areas, you can justify to yourself skipping Cruz’s six-pack (d’oh, there it is again), but players lucky enough to snag a copy will have acquired a multi-year voyager with some damn sharp art.
