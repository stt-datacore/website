A nice all-rounder crewmember to help start your early game. This PokeCaptain fills out two non-Rarity Collections from the get go and a nice helping of useful Traits. Best used for early game Voyages but will outlive his usefulness once more potent Rare crew come along. He might be the best choice for your first Behold since he’s the only one of the 3 with SCI, ENG, or MED (SCI). Plus, his long term value to your overall roster will only improve with possibly 3 more Collection notches from his untapped Traits.
