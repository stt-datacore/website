"The path of the warrior holds more challenges than can be counted. Many can be solved by cunning or skill with weapons; rare are those that require patience, and a hand both gentle and firm."

"Such was the day I became a ghuy'chaj -- the Klingon word for 'birth helper'. Keiko O'Brien was great with child, and a shipwide disaster caused her to deliver a month early. Though I had no extensive training, merely the standard Starfleet Emergency Medical course, I was the only one who could help her in that critical moment."

"Though Keiko was less...agreeable than the computerized simulation's mother, I urged her to push, and push hard. She gave birth, and I smacked the baby gently to induce breathing. Then I cut the umbilical cord -- with a regulation auto-suture, not a bat'leth as some may joke. Keiko herself deemed my performance wonderful, and said that she couldn't have done it without me."

"I was not present at my son Alexander's birth, or even aware of it until years afterward. So serving as ghuy'chaj for Molly O'Brien fills me with pride. In the words of my people, 'Today is a good day to begin life.'"

(In game terms: His MED base debuts as the 3rd highest among all Super Rare crew, and he's also the #1 MED among all Klingons and Worf variants. He's also the only Worf with SCI. Naturally he's in the Klingon collection which requires every purple Klingon immortalized to hit the 60-crew and the 80-crew rewards. He even performs well in Arena, sporting a decent Crit Bonus with no trigger and a 6-second spinup, for those of us whose rosters still lack Ardra.)
