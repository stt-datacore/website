One of the few Skill sets (MED/CMD) capable of redeeming poor Voyage numbers is fool's gold in this case - the power just isn't there. He laps his competition for the best Doc CMD Base and has some juicy Traits, but if you’re hoping his MED symbol on the Behold screen will significantly bolster your daily roster, then they won’t get what they’re after. I mean *you* won’t get what *you’re* after! Not in a million years! Not if *I* have anything to say about it!
