Craptain Sulu somehow managed to be featured crew twice without his variants being bonus. The Captain's Oath re-run tried to fix that (and failed), but Sulu’s variant event count still sits at three and his daily value is in the tank. If you take this crew, it should be for his bloated collection spot in the hopes of an expansion.
