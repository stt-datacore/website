Zim's skill set will jump off the behold page, but there's not enough power in his base and proficiency numbers to mete out the pain through the traditional daily use avenues. Instead, Zim channels his cranky old man rage into the arena.

A +10 attack boost (with position trigger met) will hold over many rosters who may have a tough time starring up legendary crew to match or want to use their crew retrievals for other needs. The Shenzhou, available from Dabo, is a good option for a fast-activating position ability. For veterans who don't need his shipboard pop, there's multi-collection value to ensure that every roster should be beholding him sooner or later.
