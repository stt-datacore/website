Camping Archer, Hidden Porthos. Haha the only person cleverer than me is the guy at WRG who said “let’s make a beagle the number one voyager and put him in a Tuesday pack.”

If you’re keeping score at home. Braxton enjoyed a three year reign at the top of the voyage charts while Fencing Picard’s lasted three months. You won’t find me saying a single bad word about that decision; the speed of power creep is a much lengthier conversation for a different forum. But the question that may be at the heart of this for you; is it worth chasing this particular top voyager? Well no, but actually yes.

Timelines has historically displaced their top ranks in most areas very slowly by video game standards and have opted to keep players engaged in other ways such as increased ad-warp opportunities and five LTOs on your screen at the same time. So when Archer’s voyage projection still has him as a viable name in four, five years or more, that’s not really such an outrageous prediction. If you’re looking for “safer” investments for your citations, you won’t find many.

But to throw a lifeline to six-pack avoiders (a more intelligent bunch you’ll never meet), the CDS skill sets are becoming indistinguishable from each other whether that’s a SEC or SCI kicker. You’ll see over a dozen of Archer’s skill set in the top 100 names at any given time and his other attributes aren’t particularly stellar.

A collection rating that’s nearly dead average on debut consists of perhaps even more traits than his episode appearance earned and there are no edge case benefits in the gauntlet or on ships. Having amassed a respectable event tally to date, however, Porthos’ shuttle-friendly skill set should have several chances each year to ride weekend shuttles and is a worthwhile supplement to their mouthwatering voyage main course.
