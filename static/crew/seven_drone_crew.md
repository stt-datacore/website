Episode 9’s Borg victory reward, provided you don’t mind missing out on some ship battle loot by choosing a Federation victory, Drone Seven is a victim of age. An ENG primary is more useful on voyages and in gauntlet where her power is no longer effective, but it hurts for shuttle seating opportunity. 

Only three traits is nearly a death knell for most crew and so it's a minor miracle that Seven has snagged a collection, a 65% gauntlet, and a reasonable number of events thus far. While those could all be beneficial for the right player in the right situation, her years-old power lets her down in most of those areas.

With her traits obviously severely limiting her collection potential, feel free to pass on this Borg until you're ready to reach a collection threshold or if you're brand new and could squeeze a few battles out of her in the gauntlet.
