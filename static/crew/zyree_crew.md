You're a new crew. A 2-dimensional being laid flat on the drawing board in WRG's offices.

"Should we make her usable in gauntlet?"

"Should we give her anything other than the worst voyage skill set in the game?"

All you hear is uproarious laughter and the sound of a cocktail shaker. This is your life as a Dosi.

In brief, the only area of the game where Zyree functions is on voyages, thanks to reasonable debut voyage power and a couple of cooperating traits. But those traits being few and her skill set being flat out bad puts a short timer on her shelf life there.

If you want a keepsake from that amusing little DS9 episode, fix yourself a Gamma Quadrant Mimosa with some Tullaberry juice, kick back, and enjoy the show.
