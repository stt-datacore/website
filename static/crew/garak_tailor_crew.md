A fairly respectable SEC crew with a surprisingly good secondary DIP base which makes him great for Voyages. He is currently the only crew in the game to sport the Tailor trait if that ever comes up in events and he fills out the Cardassian collection, obviously. Nothing too special about his ship ability other than +5 evasion but Garak sits perfectly in the middle as an above-average 3* crew. He doesn't do anything amazing but fills out a niche you might not know you needed.
