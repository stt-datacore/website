Nearly indistinguishable from Changeling Founder, and thus ranked alongside her. If you covered up the name plates, it would be hard to tell the difference. Even in the arena, she's similarly usable as a quick defensive option. If you've heard good things about her anywhere but the gauntlet or ships before, it's only because she was performing with a star advantage over other crew thanks to her Mega event.
