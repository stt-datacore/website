Barclay...events? Well, not really. But with weekends his best shot at tangible use, dual 1100+ bases can at least excel in that niche with a trait-mandated cushion of bonuses.

The only other reason to behold this bug lies in the collections tab. Resourceful and Primal collections debuting in succession showed players that WRG isn't afraid of putting almost any trait on display. Already a multi-collection piece, if Broccoli snags one or two more in the future, that'd help keep him valuable enough to save you from some bottom barrel beholds.
