Locked, cocked, and loaded since the Big Book was a twinkle in my eye, we can finally proclaim; Headin' out to Eden, Yeah Brother! This Pike was a special triumvirate of base, voyage, and event power while graciously sporting a splash of SCI to avoid the dreaded redundant skill set of redundancy. Since then he's fallen to earth as a middling voyager whose base has been eclipsed by dozens of others - such is the life of a DIP crew.

While Disco megas are fading from our memories, Pike's main squeeze Strange New Worlds is revving up and though we're unlikely to see the kind of mega dominance that Discovery provided, at least Pike himself should see many more variants coming our way. NE Pike is not a special card at this stage of the game, but has some utility and is a fine mid-level behold option.
