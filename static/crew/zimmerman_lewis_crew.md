For many players, especially in the early to mid game, an ENG primary crew with even mediocre bases can go a long way - and when that crew possesses SCI/MED, they suddenly become a fleck of gold in a pan of uninteresting iron. His spot in the Innovator collection is never going to hurt crew with such sterling voyage potential (though numbers never tell the true story with a skill set this rare), but a lack of events and somewhat poor bases compared to his nearest competition, Sarina Douglas, just might.

His shipboard offering got a whole lot more interesting when a mid-2019 change to the dabo wheel added two ships with position abilities. His +10 attack (with trigger requirement met) will hold over many, many rosters who will have a tough time starring up legendary crew to match. +1 Iguana.
