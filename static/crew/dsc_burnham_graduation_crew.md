Down goes Disco in the fourth round. A somewhat sudden knockout left Disco bases holding the bag, or in this case book, and puffed up their event histories to a level that a lot of crew will never reach again. In this case give Burnham the thief trait too, because a stealth update out of nowhere also added double digit Vulcan events to her log, setting up some, well...read the arena quote.

In short, we're dubious of her continuing to match the tier 0 reliability from her 2017-2020 event 'history', but she does have those same event traits *now* as well as the Burnham brand name as a relevance cushion. With her first collection spot coming from a trait she didn't have for years, who knows what's in store for this otherwise low to mid-level event and collection piece.
