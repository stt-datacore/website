A nice change of pace from all the ENG primary Datas and sits smack dab in the middle of his variants' voyage totals. We'd like to see better voyage numbers from a more recent card, but there's no denying Data's rock solid event history which gives AoS plenty of chances to leverage a variant-best CMD. A chunk of arena damage always catches the eye, but an unfortunate combination of trigger and poor passive stats makes that offering more likely one of opportunity for players with few options.
