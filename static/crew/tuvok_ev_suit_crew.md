Well, it seems as though Security Chief Tuvok just got an upgrade! EV Suit Tuvok is pretty much an all round stellar addition to the game. His voyage numbers are top notch and he will be one of the first to sit on any SEC/CMD shuttle seat. 200% Damage at 6s is a huge boon for any budding Arena user and gives him a ton of viability to shake up the Commander ranks.

His best offering(s), though, are two stat-boosting collections for which he's essential. Perhaps not the first blue you level, because of a lack of cadet mission versatility, he's nevertheless an essential crew to immortalize before too long.
