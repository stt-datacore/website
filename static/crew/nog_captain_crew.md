We here at the Big Book have campaigned on the promise of a Ferengi mega for years and though the two party system of Discovery and Picard will continue to trounce us in the years ahead, the Ferengi's time will come. Nog's #1 CMD base during that month will be supplemented by stray standalone events in the meantime which serve to insulate his value against otherwise dreary base and voyage numbers and his non-starter skill set. Nog's a souped up super rare at this stage, but offers more than several other decrepit golds.
