Extra! Extra! New Dax just got published! Read it here! 

Someone call a doctor; I must be dreamin’! We get two Daxes in five weeks?  What’s a girl to do?  Straight out of 2017, the Jadzia Dax fountain is flowing with long-requested variants – and here we have quite possibly the most wanted of all.  Straight out of one of the greatest fourty-two minutes of episodic Science Fiction TV, Darlene Kursky is here!

Although she had the least amount of screentime of all the series regulars in Far Beyond The Stars, Jadz...er...Darlene’s usefulness to your game will far outlast most of the other writing staff under Douglas Pabst.  Sure, she isn’t the best DIP/CMD/SCI offering you may have encountered in the last six months thanks to Doopler Emissary – but she still finds usefulness out there in the stars, even if she has a worm in her belly.  Darlene finds herself the best seat-grabber for Resourceful, Civilian and Inspiring trait matches, meaning she will not be joining her other Dax sisters in the cold confines of your Cryo Vault any time soon.

To match the Voyage usefulness, Darlene brings a slew of past and likely future event use for shuttles, even finding use-cases for your daily shuttle riders if your other top DIP crew are off on a ten hour cruise.  Sadly she won’t appear on your ship as there are far better needs than Evasion – however she does have four second initiation and eight second cooldown, so it could be worse.  She’s not the best I’ve ever seen since the Puppet Masters, that’s for sure. Three Collections, all stat-boosting at that, will hopefully seal the deal if you are looking for a new book to re...I mean a new crew to join your roster.
