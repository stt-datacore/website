I do somewhat wish that Star Trek's first confirmed vaper had more auspicious card than this, but since that aspiration went all up in blackberry flavoured smoke, I suppose this'll have to do. Raffi's numbers are rather less inspiring than her conspiracy theories, barely breaking into the top 20 when it comes to DIP bases, and she's going to slide way out of your voyage rankings before you know it. 

Her Gambler trait and the inevitable Picard events will keep her relevant, as will her somewhat snappy 200% damage at 8 seconds, but she's not the kind of event crew I can see keeping unfrozen if you've already progressed past her daily numbers. Just be wary of her temper when you decide you need her again.
