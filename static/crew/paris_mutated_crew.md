Not nearly as bad as his episode, Mutated Paris contributes usable shuttle DIP for Paris events, some immediate and potential collection value, and perhaps most importantly; fusion ability. Every roster would do well to immortalize the resultant crew, Evolved Janeway, for her event and collection value and, well, because legendary crew almost always perform better than super rares. It also won't hurt to continue to collect Parises and Janeways to help stave off all frozen beholds.

Mr. Shave the Mutate asks a relatively pricey build in return (chrons and Augment items), which means you may not want to level him until the week before one of his events or when you're ready to hit another collection threshold.
