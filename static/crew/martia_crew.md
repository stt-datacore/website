Move over B'Elanna, we have a new definition of volatile. Martia erupted for three consecutive mega events in mid-2019 to tredecuple (I looked it up) her event count and has historically been an all or nothing event option from year to year.

Her trait m√©lange, which should include Brutal for the build cost, may have room for even more, but with aged bases, this Brady Bunch star is almost purely a collection consideration. Everything but Chamelod is on the table and a six collection ceiling is absolutely peachy for mid-to-late game players utilizing dead end beholds as an opportunity to work on stacking skill boosts to pump up their legendary pieces.
