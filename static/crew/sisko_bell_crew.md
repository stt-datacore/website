One of the rare cards whose value has ballooned over time, Gabe debuted at a time where both Super Rares and CMD/DIP/SEC crew were in demand on voyages. Were we ever that young? But as he’s predictably fallen off hard in that area, his traits have behaved like Miracle’s Max’s bellows of life. (CMD/DIP/SUCK is only mostly dead)

Bell’s résumé includes an event year that mimics Janeway or Spock’s output as well as consistent performances spanning the game’s near decade. The aforementioned bugaboo voyage skill set works pretty well on shuttles and ensures him ample seating to match his ample event bonuses. All those traits also allow Sisko to cast a wide collection net where he’s been pulling up the fruit of the sea. He’s a top collection crew with several very realistic untapped traits which make him an automatic behold choice for veteran players and an option worth hogging a crew slot for newer rosters just looking for daily help from their beholds.

Bye bye, boys! Have fun storming the Sanctuary District! Think it’ll work? It would take a miracle.
