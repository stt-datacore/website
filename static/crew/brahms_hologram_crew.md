She might be made of photonic energy but her skills are quite impressive. Sporting decent ENG and SCI Bases for a Rare crew, she will unlock a fair few Nodes and has a good amount of useful Traits too. Her Saturday Cadet utility makes her a must-complete crew in the early game, and please enjoy the collateral benefits of her three future Collection spots.
