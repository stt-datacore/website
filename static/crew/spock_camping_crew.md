Spock is good for the soul. A consistent event performer, Mountaineer's event history reads like a list of the Allman Brothers' greatest hits (Hey, they're underrated ok?). Yet instead of Spock overload, everyone seems happy each time he comes around. (Norm!)

Formerly of a more voyage-y flavor, Mountaineer has a little bit of rocket fuel left thanks to an octuplet of anti-matter traits, but will soon settle in as one of the better event/collection combo crew instead.

His bases, while not spectacular, are feisty enough to earn shuttle seating with a bonus which happens to occur about every other month. And that long list of traits grants him a strong combination of immediate and potential collection value tied to a name who routinely pays off the five star investment on the weekends.
