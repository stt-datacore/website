Security Hoss Molly O'Brien. Oh, hell yes.

A Mugato-esque trait lineup grants Molly a collection spot and the possibility of event thawpertunities when you least expect them. Her competent SEC base (best kept in cryo) will provide almost all of her actual use on your roster thanks to mostly poor voyage, gauntlet, and arena metrics.
