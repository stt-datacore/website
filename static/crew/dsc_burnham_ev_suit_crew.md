[Fugazi Burnham](http://i.imgur.com/6e22bYi.jpg) is in some ways a poor man's First Officer Burnham. Same great CMD base, same skill set, same, well, character. But the (wo)man in the suit is not without merit. Her numbers are great and...are actually just good enough on their own. There's no hidden gem to discover(y) here, she is simply a base/event powerhouse with strong voyage ability.
