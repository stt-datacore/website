One of the better Voyagers in the Rare collection. He has the #7 DIP base score and his SCI/SEC backups are quite respectable. If you are struggling for DIP/SCI crew slot him in. His only faults are the lack of cadet participation and no extra collection bonuses, but with such good use in voyages I canâ€™t really hold that against him.
