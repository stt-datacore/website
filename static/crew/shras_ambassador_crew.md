A former do it all crew, Shras has lost a good deal of his daily lustre, but still offers a fine return on investment. Triple collections headline this card for most players with something like Ambassador or Civilian threatening to make a Connect Four if WRG runs out of more interesting collections to add in the meantime.

There’s also a nice attack boost to be had on ships, even if it’s a hair slower than we might prefer. His bases are still worthy of a thaw, but Shras has popped an event bonus in just a single calendar year throughout the game’s entire run.
