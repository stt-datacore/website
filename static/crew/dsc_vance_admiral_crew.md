In years past, I might have been making reference to crummy old man make-up, harebrained Section 31 style plots or CMD/DIP two skillers when talking about the upper echelons of Starfleet Command, but recently, the trope of the Badmiral has fallen out of favour, and in its place, we get actual good guys at the top. So it goes with card quality - Vance may not have the voyage cred of Jameson and his Professor X hoverchair, with most of his antimatter traits filled out better by one of the gazillion crew above him with nearly identical skill sets, but Ardeth Bey will still find himself a seat on any roster that hasn't triple duped RSK or Fencing Picard. Not that we here at the Big Book sanction such things cough cough.

In other areas, he distinguishes himself a bit better, sporting a hefty CMD base that, if his silver fox good looks are anything to go by, should age gracefully, and even if none of his traits hit on a mega again, he still gets top marks as a non-bonus shuttle crew if that's your bag. Which is good, because he never changes out of his Admiral uniform, so any variants that do come along will likely be Originals (Zombie Hunter Vance, perhaps?) or the patented Character Looking The Other Way style variant.

Outside of a buck wild Brutal or Ambassador collection, Inspiring and Cultural Figure are his ceiling, but considering how many truly dreadful crew populate those milestones, there's a definite impulse to throw your Dil at Vance to fill them out instead. That being said, this should be a calculated investment - not only is Vance already crowded out by other six packers, mega crew and giveaways, but WRG shows no signs of stopping that trend, so his daily use comes with an artificially accelerated expiration date. If you chase him, you need to make your peace with that.
