Worf's brand name will win him some fans, but unless he expands on his three previous big-bonus features, a pair of dishonorable bases aren't going to win him much Faction event seating in the future. A thin trait list should see him as a multi-collection piece before too long, which is perhaps when you should start to consider beholding him.
