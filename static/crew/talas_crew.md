Sitting vaguely in the teens ranks for ENG/SEC voyagers with some vaguely eventable traits, this character you vaguely remember from a vaguely remembered series still has the raw stats to provide help to the average roster in today's landscape, even if she's not your typical top-shelf, wise investment.

Think budget Determined Janeway without all the bells and whistles (events, collections) that made Janeway a household name. Similarly, Talas' campaign will provide four stars at once, giving you the chance to utilize her on voyages - her best area of use. As for beholds, antennae fetishists get the green light to invest, but the rest of us should look for better long term or unique potential.
