Still a worthwhile voyager even years after release, we tend to discount that part of the game when talking about beholding super rares as they need most or all of their stars before they can compete with the flood of 3/4s and 4/4s coming from events. In this case, Seven has some long term value that will prevent her from being power creeped as you make that Trek.

A half dozen non-HFS traits is just the right amount to get our insect parts rubbing together in anticipation. They've already done their job in bolstering her event portfolio, resulting in more 5+ event years than not. With "regular" Seven events in the mix and a strong skill set for shuttles, Tsunkatse is a name to keep in the back of your mind for periodic thaws.

As her collection count grows, Seven will only become a more attractive card for mid-to-late game players and she should hold value for quite a while.
