EV Suit  keeps alive the time-honored tradition of Sevens flying the gauntlet flag alongside terrible bases. But despite a strong SCI roll, neither of her gauntlet pairs are likely to fetch much loot for you in trait-neutral situations - they're of middling power and buried behind walls of gauntlet favorites and exclusives. Four different 45% gauntlet sets do afford you the opportunity to bring a fresh name to your fave five, but she's not reliable enough the rest of the time.

EV Suit's bases are in even bigger trouble with a SECondary stuck in the mud behind a desirable super rare variant and her SCI primary lags behind former global gift Seven in Silver. A woeful voyage rank passing the 300 mark won't be saved by the juicy SEC/SCI skill pairing, but may find some early game use, much like her gauntlet ability. An all-'round package who lacks for power, at least the name Seven will afford her occasional stabs at shuttle bonuses in between sparse gauntlet work.
