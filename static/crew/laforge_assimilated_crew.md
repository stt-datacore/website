LaBorg is in danger of becoming one of those crew whose reputation exceeds his grasp. Granted, we at the Big Book are partly responsible for that; players have had almost three years to talk up what has been an excellent crew and a mainstay in several areas of the game. Triple collections, triple ranked gauntlet pairs (with 65% crit capability), and double dipping La Forge and Borg events is an embarrasment of riches.

Just be sure to mentally course correct as his voyage score meanders through the rank 100s and his ENG base is event bonus only. Still well-rounded and with oodles of value to offer a new player after the heroic achievement of honoring his build cost, but with much less power relative to the field these days.
