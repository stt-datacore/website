I’ll take S-words for $400, Trebeck. We know that the TAS writers had enjoyed a few Potent Potables before Sord’s episode, but WRG still decided to make him a worthwhile crew. Sord’s voyage ability is certainly waning despite a strong bevy of anti-matter traits, but sporadic use there and the occasional mega event serve to supplement his highlights; collections and arena.

One of the game’s premier shipboard options has flown under the radar for too long, but his uncommon instant damage/accuracy pairing comes online in no time and can be tougher to replace than any of the attack-boosting damage options floating around out there. With tempting collection value as another reason to stack stars, Sord is a fine behold (and immortalization) target, even if he’s not providing you with traditional, top-notch voyage and shuttle value.
