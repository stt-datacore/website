A classically strong voyage/base pairing for Raffi makes her a premium event grab for newer players, but it’s her fast-activating arena damage that will be grabbing headlines.

Coming online at four seconds, Raffi is a fine accuracy option to pair with the attack-boosting T’mir in arena who’s similarly quick and has rare appeal even to elderly players. If you’re in collections-or-bust mode, Raffi offers just enough in that area to beat out scores of other crew and rounds out her value nicely.
