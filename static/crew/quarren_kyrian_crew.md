Quarren's clumsy name and discombobulated trait set are a big distraction from good debut metrics and make for a card which may look a lot different should they ever fix the latter.

He debuted with top ten voyage and top five base metrics, establishing him as a juicy early game target for those lucky enough to snag him from his event. Despite lacking typically valuable long term attributes for a super rare, Quarren fits his role well for players who can fuse him up early in their journey and his non-standard trait set, 'correct' or not, may pay dividends in the future.
