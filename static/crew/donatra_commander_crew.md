A surprisingly impressive card that rises above bad bases and common skills, thanks to competitive Gauntlet pairs (#2 cumulative proficiency total among 4* crew), two stat boosting collections, and a snappy, if somewhat wimpy, Attack boost. Romulan events will keep her somewhat relevant on the weekends, but it’s dual collections and gauntlet work we’re after.
