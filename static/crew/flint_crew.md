Rich Corinthian traits highlighted by impeccable stitching. Flint is the renaissance man of every era and says "Look, son" to Douwds and Organians on the regular. 

So of course he's a collection sleeping giant and one of the best possible speculative grabs in that area. And anti-matter traits numbering six without Federation or Starfleet is a rare feat indeed. With a unique skill order among legendary crew, the pieces of Flint's remarkable portraiture continue to fall into place.

Debuting with just barely a top ten base, Laz should be usable for event shuttles when his banquet of traits pop a bonus, though that's more of the icing on the cake alongside Baby's First Gauntlet-type proficiencies. If you care for card art, flavor text, or traits, Flint is the full piquancy package and worth a gander even if his power won't blow you away.
