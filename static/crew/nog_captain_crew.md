We here at the Big Book have campaigned on the promise of a Ferengi mega for years and though the two party system of Discovery and Picard will continue to trounce us in the years ahead, the Ferengi's time will come.

Barring that increasingly theoretical mega, Nog is just about tapped out in terms of value growth. Both of his viable traits are already collections and it would take something like an Alternate Future collection for him to become any more desirable than he is, or isn’t, right now. Nog's a souped-up super rare at this stage, but at least offers more than several other decrepit golds.
