Finding a good DIP base is rather like finding the perfect mate. No, wait, come back! I promise I’m going somewhere with this! All right, so it’s worth noting that DIP is the single most common skill in the game, so, if you’ll follow my analogy, there’s plenty of fish in the sea. While it can be easy to chase the new hotness, or the crew with the biggest . . . numbers, you ideally want to find a DIP base that splits the difference between event performance, voyage work, and other daily utility (shuttles, Gauntlet, etc). You want to find the perfect mate.

Sadly enough, Jean Grey just isn’t onatopp of things in most of these areas, serving up a lesser base than New Eden Pike or Pining Vina, lacking the event versatility of Zhin’tara Odo, or any of the usual fringe benefits you want out of someone who’s going to average, at best, maybe one whole event a year. In the end, this particular phoenix is more Last Stand than First Class, but hey. If you’re particularly Taken, then who am I to deny love?
