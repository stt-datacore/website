Torpcoy debuted relatively low on the power scale, no doubt WRG's response to having to print a good voyage skill set. That's aged him faster than most crew - well, that and having to hotwire a bomb seconds before the Enterprise was destroyed - but he's remained a fairly interesting card overall.

Unlikely to venture outside of his designated MED/ENG lane on voyages due to low strength metrics, McCoy's voyage-centric skill set isn't optimal for shuttles either. Although you'd expect Bones events to be thick with MED seats and Physician, Exobiology, and Jury Rigger are sort of the holy triumvirate for their respective skills, WRG loves to just throw out obnoxious seating in events, such as a certain innovator mega that was 90% SEC seats.

Nevertheless, McCoy should still find *some* kind of seat to fit for the foreseeable future, while his value in the realms of collections and arena are what really buoy this card into a nice, well rounded shape. Don't let that coveted skill set whisper lies to you about what McCoy can accomplish, but he has his fingers in enough pies to offer some kind of value to just about any roster.
