First, Kirk's event history. Besides boasting more events than any other character, he's coming off a hellacious 2019, notching seven events during the year, tying him with the only other names to have matched that mark; Jadzia (7) and Janeway (7) back in 2017. Even though his Faction rate has cooled after going nine for his first nine, he's still a slam dunk lock for events until the end of time(lines). Paired with a fat DIP score, he may be someone worth duplicating if the opportunity arises.

I would squeeze in a mention about a passable arena ability if his note needed fleshing out, but it really doesn't, thanks to his other monstrous attribute - the best super rare voyage score. In all likelihood, the next purple to top his #1 ranking there is going to end up pipping one or more legendary crew as well since Kirk sits single digit points behind formerly noteworthy gauntlet crew Ambassador Troi and the rest of the legendaries. You may not need more of his skill set, but since he performs for voyages like a 3/5 legendary would, here's your chance to replace and freeze another super rare if you're still using them in that part of the game.
