Hell hath no fury...Well, Angela wasn't exactly scorned, but one of the biggest Romantic SEC bases and a nickel will get you a cuppa coffee. (sorry, we're working from a very old joke book)

That's just to say that while she may have some shuttle-friendly bases and a few eventable traits, only Survivalist has managed to make a dent in the standings thus far, so her thawpertunities may be few and far between. But only one of those three dominos has fallen in the collections tab, so things may at least improve there.

In the short term, voyages will be her calling card. Strong debut numbers magically dodge a far worse skill set than she could have been saddled with and give her some play there on earlier rosters. Considering the top notch golds in her debut 6-pack, it's easy to imagine that children of all ages have a copy or two of her floating around on their rosters before she enters the portal. Not the best long term profile out there for endgame rosters, but at least some sort of value for every level of player.
