FOB is the poster child for return on investment. She's only dropped a handful of voyage ranks (and one base rank) after over three years in the game and may still be making shuttle and voyage runs when your toddler is accepting their diploma. CMD/SCI's value over replacement on voyages isn't top shelf, but Burnham will remain a strong option while exotic skill sets with middling power have dropped from use entirely.

She's also been the event boss, grabbing fistful after fistful of event bonuses. With Disco blanket bonuses likely cooled off, she'll have to settle for merely 'very reliable' variant event work going forward to highlight a huge CMD score that can even perform non-bonus work admirably. Slow, triggerless arena damage is a great new player perk, but it's her stability as a behold and citation investment that has her sitting pretty among the top names in the game.
