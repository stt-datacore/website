His name is Buck and he’s here to party. For a weekday pack filler, Buck offers some surprising utility. His event count seems to be a dud now, but he claims two traits from a recent mega event survey (Cultural Figure, Explorer) and boasts great super rare SEC ranks for both. That same base is usable for daily shuttles and a new player who stumbled into a fused Buck early may find his voyage numbers useful, even if the skill set is not. Even his arena offering is usable; fast accuracy with a chunk of crit bonus. The buried lede is a nice pair of collections which makes him ‘necessary’ for completionists. For a non-event crew with the CMD/DIP/SEC skill set, this is the absolute upper limit of crew value.
