Working in concert with an interesting trait set and a base that remains stout, Zhian'tara's weekend situation is a special offering that you want to acquire if possible and allows him to stand out on rosters, even as his utility narrows.","action":{"bonus_amount":6,"charge_phases":[{"charge_time":6,"bonus_amount":7},{"charge_time":8,"bonus_amount":8}],"name":"It's Better This Way","symbol":"odo_curzon_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":6,"duration":10,"bonus_type":0,"crew":2806737,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_odo_curzon_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":4,"amount":1000},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":580,"evasion":440,"crit_chance":5,"crit_bonus":225}},{"archetype_id":6145,"symbol":"odo_future_crew","name":"Gaia Odo","short_name":"Odo","max_rarity":2,"traits":["changeling","bajoran","constable","romantic","communicator"],"traits_named":["Changeling","Bajoran","Constable","Romantic","Communicator"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","male","organic","ds9","odo","crew_max_rarity_2"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_odo_future_sm.png","collections":["Uncommon Crew"],"totalChronCost":448,"factionOnlyTotal":46,"craftCost":216600,"bigbook_tier":4,"events":14,"ranks":{"voyRank":888,"gauntletRank":913,"chronCostRank":659,"B_SEC":488,"A_SEC":499,"B_DIP":464,"A_DIP":473,"V_CMD_SCI":918,"V_CMD_SEC":864,"G_CMD_SEC":722,"V_CMD_ENG":920,"V_CMD_DIP":822,"G_CMD_DIP":707,"V_CMD_MED":920,"V_SCI_SEC":860,"G_SCI_SEC":763,"V_SCI_ENG":911,"V_SCI_DIP":795,"G_SCI_DIP":681,"V_SCI_MED":912,"V_SEC_ENG":856,"G_SEC_ENG":656,"V_SEC_DIP":739,"G_SEC_DIP":616,"V_SEC_MED":836,"G_SEC_MED":627,"V_ENG_DIP":783,"G_ENG_DIP":652,"V_ENG_MED":914,"V_DIP_MED":748,"G_DIP_MED":560},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":384,"range_min":54,"range_max":134},"security_skill":{"core":260,"range_min":24,"range_max":83}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":343,"range_min":54,"range_max":134},"security_skill":{"core":211,"range_min":24,"range_max":83}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"For those that don’t have Tilly, there’s Odo.

If you invest in him, especially considering the odds of the pack he comes from, make it for sentimental reasons and enjoy his daily use until he's eaten by a giant tinfoil space worm.","action":{"bonus_amount":8,"name":"We've Got To Destroy It!","symbol":"matt_decker_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":6,"limit":2,"bonus_type":0,"crew":2808781,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_matt_decker_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":1,"amount":400},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":200,"evasion":25,"crit_chance":215,"crit_bonus":100}},{"archetype_id":9084,"symbol":"joseph_chef_crew","name":"Joseph Sisko","short_name":"Joseph","max_rarity":5,"traits":["human","resourceful","caregiver","chef","federation","civilian","communicator"],"traits_named":["Human","Resourceful","Caregiver","Chef","Federation","Civilian","Communicator"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","ds9","joseph","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_joseph_chef_sm.png","collections":[],"totalChronCost":1032,"factionOnlyTotal":45,"craftCost":835500,"bigbook_tier":10,"events":4,"ranks":{"voyRank":383,"gauntletRank":241,"chronCostRank":437,"B_SCI":76,"A_SCI":93,"B_DIP":112,"A_DIP":68,"V_CMD_SCI":300,"G_CMD_SCI":425,"V_CMD_SEC":748,"V_CMD_ENG":726,"V_CMD_DIP":275,"G_CMD_DIP":116,"V_CMD_MED":695,"V_SCI_SEC":305,"G_SCI_SEC":405,"V_SCI_ENG":238,"G_SCI_ENG":270,"V_SCI_DIP":26,"G_SCI_DIP":10,"V_SCI_MED":186,"G_SCI_MED":257,"V_SEC_ENG":697,"V_SEC_DIP":272,"G_SEC_DIP":98,"V_SEC_MED":691,"V_ENG_DIP":170,"G_ENG_DIP":34,"V_ENG_MED":577,"V_DIP_MED":168,"G_DIP_MED":61},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":1006,"range_min":317,"range_max":644},"science_skill":{"core":988,"range_min":133,"range_max":272}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":616,"range_min":317,"range_max":644},"science_skill":{"core":540,"range_min":133,"range_max":272}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":642,"range_min":317,"range_max":644},"science_skill":{"core":585,"range_min":133,"range_max":272}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":720,"range_min":317,"range_max":644},"science_skill":{"core":680,"range_min":133,"range_max":272}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":856,"range_min":317,"range_max":644},"science_skill":{"core":819,"range_min":133,"range_max":272}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"His gumbo sure is smellin' good, but it's the rest of this card that stinks.

Pair her with some fast activating crit crew like Ardra/Karr/Scott and rake in the rewards from three second ship battles. She can save you hours of gameplay over the course of countless arena dailies and skirmishes and unlike the aforementioned gauntlet counterparts, does benefit well from extra stars (you’ll want to get her to +9/10 attack for those one shots or spend another seat for an attack crew).\n\nThat being said, Killy’s usefulness is clearly on the decline. Her event count is propped up by five previous mega events and though that may or may not continue, her variant events have been strangely lacking. Discovery (her primary event consideration) CMD options have sprung up around her and her voyage work is now below average. Several crew introduced in 2019 have encroached on her arena credentials which also steals some of the value that came from its exclusivity.

Since her debut, she's remained firmly in Kahless' shadow. True, she doesn't measure up to him in most gauntlets, but few do. She's still quality crew and quibbles about her usually center around her cost. Four ranked gauntlet pairs, including a firm hold on the #1 MED/CMD combo, is a good place to start. But despite a top five MED proficiency, there are a few chinks in the armor. Her five traits don't collect crit bonuses quite as often as some gauntleteers and the MED ranks are overrun by more accessible super rare crew. She'll do fine as one of your gauntlet five, but don't expect her to be head and shoulders above her peers.\n\nHer value elsewhere is on the decline and accounts for much of the reason she's often passed over at her price point. Bev's bases are frankly bad, as is expected from gauntlet crew, but without a healthy event clip to soften the blow, she's someone who might not make more than a single shuttle event per year, even with plenty of stars. Voyages are the other place you'd likely employ her. She's fine there (with honor investment) and retains an uncommon MED/CMD skill pairing and MED primary; neither of which are particularly easy to come by. Chasing the treadmill of rankings is understandable, but Bev's great skill set and chunk of proficiency keeps her status as a useful crew member in the face of slipping base and voyage power.","action":{"bonus_amount":6,"charge_phases":[{"charge_time":6,"bonus_amount":8},{"charge_time":8,"bonus_amount":10}],"name":"Not On My Ship!","symbol":"crusher_captain_action","cooldown":4,"initial_cooldown":4,"duration":6,"bonus_type":1,"crew":2809003,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_crusher_captain_icon"},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":250,"evasion":500,"crit_chance":85,"crit_bonus":100}},{"archetype_id":8448,"symbol":"crusher_merrymen_crew","name":"Merry Men Crusher","short_name":"Crusher","max_rarity":5,"traits":["human","starfleet","federation","doctor","costumed","resourceful"],"traits_named":["Human","Starfleet","Federation","Physician","Costumed","Resourceful"],"traits_hidden":["female","organic","tng","commander","crusher","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_crusher_merrymen_sm.png","collections":["Do No Harm","Sherwood Forest"],"totalChronCost":1070,"factionOnlyTotal":21,"craftCost":581650,"bigbook_tier":7,"events":5,"ranks":{"voyRank":271,"gauntletRank":622,"chronCostRank":704,"B_SCI":300,"A_SCI":308,"B_SEC":53,"A_SEC":79,"B_MED":22,"A_MED":41,"V_CMD_SCI":485,"G_CMD_SCI":606,"V_CMD_SEC":228,"G_CMD_SEC":425,"V_CMD_ENG":674,"V_CMD_DIP":726,"V_CMD_MED":163,"G_CMD_MED":576,"V_SCI_SEC":41,"G_SCI_SEC":135,"V_SCI_ENG":334,"G_SCI_ENG":386,"V_SCI_DIP":511,"G_SCI_DIP":610,"V_SCI_MED":49,"G_SCI_MED":223,"V_SEC_ENG":153,"G_SEC_ENG":327,"V_SEC_DIP":247,"G_SEC_DIP":455,"V_SEC_MED":5,"G_SEC_MED":120,"V_ENG_DIP":688,"V_ENG_MED":125,"G_ENG_MED":352,"V_DIP_MED":196,"G_DIP_MED":541},"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":1160,"range_min":195,"range_max":257},"medicine_skill":{"core":1122,"range_min":53,"range_max":158},"science_skill":{"core":419,"range_min":69,"range_max":186}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":770,"range_min":195,"range_max":257},"medicine_skill":{"core":674,"range_min":53,"range_max":158},"science_skill":{"core":194,"range_min":69,"range_max":186}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":796,"range_min":195,"range_max":257},"medicine_skill":{"core":719,"range_min":53,"range_max":158},"science_skill":{"core":218,"range_min":69,"range_max":186}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":874,"range_min":195,"range_max":257},"medicine_skill":{"core":814,"range_min":53,"range_max":158},"science_skill":{"core":263,"range_min":69,"range_max":186}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":1010,"range_min":195,"range_max":257},"medicine_skill":{"core":953,"range_min":53,"range_max":158},"science_skill":{"core":360,"range_min":69,"range_max":186}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"First off, let's all take a moment to appreciate the best crew name this game has ever produced.

Twelve seconds is on the slow side nowadays, but 2700 combined crit rating and 1750 passive accuracy is a nice chunk of stats worth considering.","action":{"bonus_amount":7,"name":"New Collective","symbol":"seven_bluegreyshoulders_action","cooldown":14,"initial_cooldown":12,"duration":10,"bonus_type":2,"crew":2809947,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_sevenbluegreyshoulders_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":4,"amount":2000},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":1750,"evasion":440,"crit_chance":705}},{"archetype_id":3148,"symbol":"seven_wwii_crew","name":"Mademoiselle de Neuf","short_name":"Seven","max_rarity":5,"traits":["human","borg","civilian","federation","costumed","saboteur","musician"],"traits_named":["Human","Borg","Civilian","Federation","Costumed","Saboteur","Musician"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","female","organic","voy","bridge_crew","seven","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_sevenwwii_sm.png","collections":["Resistance Is Futile"],"totalChronCost":1481,"factionOnlyTotal":116,"craftCost":755200,"bigbook_tier":8,"events":16,"ranks":{"voyRank":290,"gauntletRank":25,"chronCostRank":21,"B_SCI":162,"A_SCI":142,"B_SEC":134,"A_SEC":88,"B_ENG":217,"A_ENG":181,"V_CMD_SCI":291,"G_CMD_SCI":211,"V_CMD_SEC":240,"G_CMD_SEC":205,"V_CMD_ENG":361,"G_CMD_ENG":211,"V_CMD_DIP":731,"V_CMD_MED":635,"V_SCI_SEC":16,"G_SCI_SEC":11,"V_SCI_ENG":76,"G_SCI_ENG":20,"V_SCI_DIP":309,"G_SCI_DIP":237,"V_SCI_MED":179,"G_SCI_MED":148,"V_SEC_ENG":42,"G_SEC_ENG":5,"V_SEC_DIP":270,"G_SEC_DIP":188,"V_SEC_MED":136,"G_SEC_MED":80,"V_ENG_DIP":392,"G_ENG_DIP":249,"V_ENG_MED":213,"G_ENG_MED":142,"V_DIP_MED":638},"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":954,"range_min":254,"range_max":516},"science_skill":{"core":777,"range_min":166,"range_max":441},"engineering_skill":{"core":441,"range_min":182,"range_max":358}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":575,"range_min":254,"range_max":516},"science_skill":{"core":387,"range_min":166,"range_max":441},"engineering_skill":{"core":216,"range_min":182,"range_max":358}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":592,"range_min":254,"range_max":516},"science_skill":{"core":413,"range_min":166,"range_max":441},"engineering_skill":{"core":240,"range_min":182,"range_max":358}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":683,"range_min":254,"range_max":516},"science_skill":{"core":491,"range_min":166,"range_max":441},"engineering_skill":{"core":285,"range_min":182,"range_max":358}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":805,"range_min":254,"range_max":516},"science_skill":{"core":627,"range_min":166,"range_max":441},"engineering_skill":{"core":382,"range_min":182,"range_max":358}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"Don't let Mrs. Gangster Spock's numbers fool you.

In combination with a strong stat total (and voyage MED), she's among the most impactful voyagers in the game whose value above replacement blows past CMD/SEC also-rans with similar overall numbers.\n\nEqually as mouth-watering is event eligibility to rival the fabled Zhian'tara Odo. Triggering bonuses for Doc, Seven, and Borg events, the trait and variant mish mash has given her a minimum of four events in each of the last three years.

He’s even useable in the Arena, with a somewhat slow but powerful straight Attack boost. And yet, he still falls short of his more well groomed brother, Lt.

With MED bringing up the Faction rear accounting for roughly 5-6% of event seating, there are weekends where you won't see a single MED seat across any of the 3-seat missions and only sprinkled in sparingly elsewhere. Yet with only three super rares able to match him with a bonus, Bones often only needs one opportunity to be the best choice.\n\nThe value of a naked shuttle score is among the most variable attributes to try and rank.

However struggling for MED crew is common so don’t dismiss him too quickly, just be prepared to move him on quickly when someone better comes along.","action":{"bonus_amount":3,"charge_phases":[{"charge_time":8,"ability_amount":750},{"charge_time":8,"ability_amount":1000}],"name":"Super Hydration","symbol":"phlox_scrubs_action","cooldown":8,"initial_cooldown":1,"duration":10,"bonus_type":1,"crew":2812450,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_phloxscrubs_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":6,"amount":500},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"evasion":75,"crit_chance":81,"crit_bonus":150}},{"archetype_id":6681,"symbol":"phlox_defensive_crew","name":"Defensive Phlox","short_name":"Phlox","max_rarity":5,"traits":["denobulan","civilian","doctor","romantic","exobiology"],"traits_named":["Denobulan","Civilian","Physician","Romantic","Exobiology"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","ent","phlox","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_phlox_defensive_sm.png","collections":["Do No Harm"],"totalChronCost":1004,"factionOnlyTotal":70,"craftCost":621650,"bigbook_tier":4,"events":12,"ranks":{"voyRank":248,"gauntletRank":12,"chronCostRank":207,"B_SCI":166,"A_SCI":139,"B_SEC":401,"A_SEC":370,"B_MED":43,"A_MED":19,"V_CMD_SCI":274,"G_CMD_SCI":187,"V_CMD_SEC":480,"G_CMD_SEC":433,"V_CMD_ENG":669,"V_CMD_DIP":721,"V_CMD_MED":66,"G_CMD_MED":8,"V_SCI_SEC":69,"G_SCI_SEC":26,"V_SCI_ENG":219,"G_SCI_ENG":150,"V_SCI_DIP":298,"G_SCI_DIP":214,"V_SCI_MED":18,"G_SCI_MED":1,"V_SEC_ENG":388,"G_SEC_ENG":334,"V_SEC_DIP":528,"G_SEC_DIP":467,"V_SEC_MED":16,"G_SEC_MED":2,"V_ENG_DIP":683,"V_ENG_MED":58,"G_ENG_MED":3,"V_DIP_MED":98,"G_DIP_MED":26},"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":934,"range_min":261,"range_max":913},"science_skill":{"core":765,"range_min":174,"range_max":461},"security_skill":{"core":403,"range_min":147,"range_max":297}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":582,"range_min":261,"range_max":913},"science_skill":{"core":317,"range_min":174,"range_max":461},"security_skill":{"core":178,"range_min":147,"range_max":297}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":597,"range_min":261,"range_max":913},"science_skill":{"core":362,"range_min":174,"range_max":461},"security_skill":{"core":202,"range_min":147,"range_max":297}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":684,"range_min":261,"range_max":913},"science_skill":{"core":457,"range_min":174,"range_max":461},"security_skill":{"core":247,"range_min":147,"range_max":297}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":808,"range_min":261,"range_max":913},"science_skill":{"core":596,"range_min":174,"range_max":461},"security_skill":{"core":344,"range_min":147,"range_max":297}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"He's an absolute unit.

As a card, he's just fantastic and incredibly useful day to day. On voyages he has a delicious skill set which is weighted to put him on the right part of the ENG/MED curve and in conjunction with a good overall score is unlikely to be completely displaced from those voyages any time soon. Even more impressive than guaranteed voyage job security (which is hard to do) is Caretaker's gauntlet résumé.\n\nHis #1 ENG proficiency isn't just good, it's stupid good. The names below him include a 1-skill crew and a super rare. That monster ENG roll gives him ownership of four ranked gauntlet pairs as well as the top ENG/MED pair by a bigger margin over number two than any other skill combo - almost 300 points. I'll cut the accolades short, but suffice it to say, he's a banger. His biggest (only) weakness is rarely exceeding 25% crit, but with such a huge lead over the competition, your best option against him is usually 50 merits.\n\nSo what do we do with our copies of Banjo Man? There's no clear-cut answer. It's certainly tempting to want to feed him citations for his prodigious voyage potential. If you did that before the changes to gauntlet rewards (✋guilty) and land another copy, do you keep him? His voyage offering is still unique enough that you shouldn't feel bad for doing so if you have space and you can always fly the double Caretaker formation in gauntlet. But if you haven't cited him yet, you're getting 50% or more of his benefit with just that first star.

Let's start at the collections tab, where he's nearly peerless. An early 2019 server push pushed Locutus into rarefied air as one of three crew to appear in three stat-boosting collections, including the exclusive percent-per-crew Gauntlet group. The raw voyage numbers are still strong, and while a DIP/SEC set may not seem impressive, he joins the Xindi Bug as the only crew with his skill set in the top 50 voyagers.\n\nHis wheelhouse remains the gauntlet where only he and The Caretaker own two #1 ranked skill pairings (four overall). A massive DIP proficiency is the best single roll in the game and often boosted by a half dozen frequently seen crit traits. His unique arena ability (1 second attack) can allow some skirmish shenanigans with fast-activating damage crew and shave a lot of time off your weekends.\n\nThe elephant in the room is clearly a set of poor bases. Though not at Gowron levels of disgusting, they're bad enough to be mistaken for a super rare, even at 5/5. His opportunities are fairly frequent thanks to Picard and Borg weekends (#2 Borg DIP) which are due for an uptick in 2020, but he'll perform noticeably behind the top ranked crew and has more variant competition than any other character. Thanks to his uniqueness in several areas including collections and the arena, he's arguably the most well-rounded crew in the game.","action":{"bonus_amount":9,"name":"Resistance is Futile","symbol":"locutus_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":1,"duration":10,"bonus_type":0,"crew":2814190,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_locutus_icon"},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":325,"evasion":490,"crit_chance":5,"crit_bonus":100}},{"archetype_id":138,"symbol":"picard_firstcontact_crew","name":"Enterprise-E Picard","short_name":"Picard","max_rarity":5,"traits":["federation","starfleet","human","inspiring","astrophysicist","exoarchaeology","musician","tactician"],"traits_named":["Federation","Starfleet","Human","Inspiring","Astrophysicist","Exoarchaeology","Musician","Tactician"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","tng","captain","bridge_crew","picard","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_picardfirstcontact_sm.png","collections":["To Boldly Go"],"totalChronCost":1871,"factionOnlyTotal":53,"craftCost":902500,"bigbook_tier":9,"events":18,"ranks":{"voyRank":301,"gauntletRank":93,"chronCostRank":131,"B_CMD":184,"A_CMD":166,"B_SEC":373,"A_SEC":395,"B_DIP":124,"A_DIP":100,"V_CMD_SCI":265,"G_CMD_SCI":239,"V_CMD_SEC":156,"G_CMD_SEC":172,"V_CMD_ENG":245,"G_CMD_ENG":182,"V_CMD_DIP":49,"G_CMD_DIP":19,"V_CMD_MED":207,"G_CMD_MED":179,"V_SCI_SEC":482,"G_SCI_SEC":581,"V_SCI_ENG":555,"V_SCI_DIP":195,"G_SCI_DIP":122,"V_SCI_MED":536,"V_SEC_ENG":416,"G_SEC_ENG":512,"V_SEC_DIP":101,"G_SEC_DIP":69,"V_SEC_MED":379,"G_SEC_MED":495,"V_ENG_DIP":159,"G_ENG_DIP":79,"V_ENG_MED":511,"V_DIP_MED":155,"G_DIP_MED":104},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":982,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":852,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":449,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":592,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":404,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":224,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":618,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":449,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":248,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":696,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":544,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":293,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":832,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":683,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":390,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"When your character has almost twenty variants, a few duds are expected.

However, for a strong DIP/ENG card that ticks off another step of the Jury Rigger list, Scared Scotty easily makes for a card worth keeping.","action":{"bonus_amount":5,"name":"I Don't Remember","symbol":"scott_scared_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":12,"duration":10,"bonus_type":1,"crew":2814862,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_scotty_scared_icon"},"ability":{"condition":1,"type":0,"amount":3},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":370,"evasion":250,"crit_chance":17,"crit_bonus":145}},{"archetype_id":9181,"symbol":"armus_crew","name":"Armus","short_name":"Armus","max_rarity":5,"traits":["villain","desperate","survivalist","brutal","telekinetic"],"traits_named":["Villain","Desperate","Survivalist","Brutal","Telekinetic"],"traits_hidden":["male","nonhuman","organic","tng","armus","gauntlet_jackpot","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_armus_sm.png","collections":["A New Challenger Approaches"],"totalChronCost":1425,"factionOnlyTotal":32,"craftCost":714050,"bigbook_tier":4,"events":6,"ranks":{"voyRank":215,"gauntletRank":4,"chronCostRank":435,"B_CMD":218,"A_CMD":159,"B_SCI":104,"A_SCI":43,"B_SEC":398,"A_SEC":347,"V_CMD_SCI":17,"G_CMD_SCI":1,"V_CMD_SEC":141,"G_CMD_SEC":26,"V_CMD_ENG":219,"G_CMD_ENG":57,"V_CMD_DIP":333,"G_CMD_DIP":173,"V_CMD_MED":186,"G_CMD_MED":51,"V_SCI_SEC":31,"G_SCI_SEC":5,"V_SCI_ENG":125,"G_SCI_ENG":21,"V_SCI_DIP":149,"G_SCI_DIP":27,"V_SCI_MED":87,"G_SCI_MED":22,"V_SEC_ENG":368,"G_SEC_ENG":285,"V_SEC_DIP":502,"G_SEC_DIP":419,"V_SEC_MED":322,"G_SEC_MED":253,"V_ENG_DIP":678,"V_ENG_MED":456,"V_DIP_MED":614},"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":908,"range_min":321,"range_max":821},"command_skill":{"core":734,"range_min":256,"range_max":578},"security_skill":{"core":406,"range_min":162,"range_max":331}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":556,"range_min":321,"range_max":821},"command_skill":{"core":306,"range_min":256,"range_max":578},"security_skill":{"core":181,"range_min":162,"range_max":331}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":571,"range_min":321,"range_max":821},"command_skill":{"core":350,"range_min":256,"range_max":578},"security_skill":{"core":205,"range_min":162,"range_max":331}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":658,"range_min":321,"range_max":821},"command_skill":{"core":440,"range_min":256,"range_max":578},"security_skill":{"core":250,"range_min":162,"range_max":331}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":782,"range_min":321,"range_max":821},"command_skill":{"core":572,"range_min":256,"range_max":578},"security_skill":{"core":347,"range_min":162,"range_max":331}}}],"in_portal":false,"markdownContent":"After the awesome dominance of The Caretaker, Armus seems like a step down as the rare gauntlet reward.

His stat-boosting collection spot is a perk and worth several times a normal collection spot due to its exclusivity, even if it's a fairly miniscule boost overall. He's fine for voyages; about average by the numbers/skill set, but likely not a crew whose duplicate would be used there.\n\nFor anyone considering citations in a collection-chasing effort, that's rarely going to be the best use of your honor. He's not good enough outside of the gauntlet to be worth the citations and with the change to gauntlet reward exclusivity, additional copies will continue to trickle in.

And God help you if the Disco megas end - if that happens, she'll be leaning heavily on Mirror to leverage any kind of event utility, and lemme tell ya, that ain't where you want to hang your hat right now, one whole year after the last standalone Mirror weekend.","action":{"bonus_amount":6,"name":"What A Team We Are!","symbol":"may_fungus_action","cooldown":16,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":6,"bonus_type":2,"crew":2815907,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_may_fungus_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":2,"amount":20},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":150,"evasion":25,"crit_chance":185,"crit_bonus":100}},{"archetype_id":4082,"symbol":"kehleyr_mirror_crew","name":"Mirror K'Ehleyr","short_name":"K'Ehleyr","max_rarity":4,"traits":["klingon","brutal","tactician","duelist","human","kca","mirror_universe"],"traits_named":["Klingon","Brutal","Tactician","Duelist","Human","Klingon-Cardassian Alliance","Mirror Universe"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","female","organic","kehleyr","mirror","original","ds9","tng","crew_max_rarity_4"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_kehleyrmirror_sm.png","collections":["Timelines' Originals"],"totalChronCost":1593,"factionOnlyTotal":44,"craftCost":431850,"bigbook_tier":8,"events":16,"ranks":{"voyRank":603,"gauntletRank":647,"chronCostRank":256,"B_CMD":432,"A_CMD":436,"B_SEC":243,"A_SEC":236,"B_DIP":295,"A_DIP":345,"V_CMD_SCI":641,"G_CMD_SCI":661,"V_CMD_SEC":340,"G_CMD_SEC":226,"V_CMD_ENG":591,"G_CMD_ENG":615,"V_CMD_DIP":425,"G_CMD_DIP":530,"V_CMD_MED":554,"G_CMD_MED":567,"V_SCI_SEC":468,"G_SCI_SEC":299,"V_SCI_ENG":739,"V_SCI_DIP":578,"G_SCI_DIP":726,"V_SCI_MED":720,"V_SEC_ENG":406,"G_SEC_ENG":268,"V_SEC_DIP":293,"G_SEC_DIP":272,"V_SEC_MED":369,"G_SEC_MED":234,"V_ENG_DIP":563,"G_ENG_DIP":701,"V_ENG_MED":717,"V_DIP_MED":482,"G_DIP_MED":603},"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":672,"range_min":161,"range_max":354},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":622,"range_min":36,"range_max":109},"command_skill":{"core":394,"range_min":60,"range_max":160}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":441,"range_min":161,"range_max":354},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":394,"range_min":36,"range_max":109},"command_skill":{"core":274,"range_min":60,"range_max":160}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":488,"range_min":161,"range_max":354},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":445,"range_min":36,"range_max":109},"command_skill":{"core":303,"range_min":60,"range_max":160}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":567,"range_min":161,"range_max":354},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":518,"range_min":36,"range_max":109},"command_skill":{"core":337,"range_min":60,"range_max":160}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"Not a daily use crew, but worth having thanks to an inexplicable four event features and a healthy number of other trait events.

In the debate of utility versus raw power, it's clear which side Leucon comes down on.","action":{"bonus_amount":9,"name":"You Can Make A Difference Here","symbol":"leucon_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":10,"bonus_type":1,"crew":2816552,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_leucon_icon"},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":445,"evasion":365,"crit_chance":140,"crit_bonus":100}},{"archetype_id":98,"symbol":"dax_jadzia_lieutenant_s1_crew","name":"Lt.

In Boothby's case, it gives him a totally unique skill order and a matchup advantage in gauntlet encounters. If you've missed out on the ubiquitous Surak or Locutus, Boothby does a fair imitation. In Soviet Quadrant, re-creation blows YOU to high heavens. His three ranked pairs include a #2 SCI/DIP which edges out Surak by a small margin and can easily two-for-one gauntlet exclusive Armus - the blob who also toppled Surak from the SCI/CMD catbird seat.\n\nIn short, Boothby's skill set makes him a great choice to break up SCI-centric walls in the gauntlet and, in combination with a huge stat total, makes him one of the best voyagers in the game. There are definite holes to Boothby's game - a lack of event work and unexciting arena prospects - and relative to the strength of newer cards, his bases are merely ok.

Maximillian Of The Woods is kind of an inverse Queen Po but a more relative comparison would be the Borg Queen, my oh my he keeps royal company!

The raw base and voyage numbers are there to make him usable on any roster with the requisite number of stars, it's just that the rest of him screams pack filler.\n\nBearing in mind we have not had an Enterprise mega yet, his event usage in the future is still limited and whilst both he and Queen are similar in numbers (with Forrest having a small advantage) I would probably still prioritise the latter due to Forrest lacking any kind of flavor. No doubt you might hear some superhero stories from people who got him 4/5 out of a campaign and found his numbers and Diplomat tag extremely helpful, but if you missed out, you'll struggle to justify finishing him when better skill sets come your way.","action":{"bonus_amount":7,"name":"It's Time to Swim","symbol":"forrest_maxwell_admiral_action","cooldown":14,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":8,"bonus_type":1,"crew":2817426,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_forrest_admiral_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":2,"amount":25},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":405,"evasion":425,"crit_chance":100,"crit_bonus":320}},{"archetype_id":10976,"symbol":"ari_bn_bem_crew","name":"Commander Ari bn Bem","short_name":"Bem","max_rarity":5,"traits":["pandronian","resourceful","crafty","diplomat","explorer","investigator"],"traits_named":["Pandronian","Resourceful","Crafty","Diplomat","Explorer","Investigator"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","nonhuman","tas","ari_bn_bem","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_ari_bn_bem_sm.png","collections":["New Life and New Civilizations"],"totalChronCost":1653,"factionOnlyTotal":24,"craftCost":590400,"bigbook_tier":4,"events":0,"ranks":{"voyRank":235,"gauntletRank":5,"chronCostRank":442,"B_SCI":56,"A_SCI":9,"B_SEC":232,"A_SEC":208,"B_MED":164,"A_MED":145,"V_CMD_SCI":101,"G_CMD_SCI":21,"V_CMD_SEC":347,"G_CMD_SEC":250,"V_CMD_ENG":666,"V_CMD_DIP":720,"V_CMD_MED":378,"G_CMD_MED":146,"V_SCI_SEC":7,"G_SCI_SEC":3,"V_SCI_ENG":106,"G_SCI_ENG":22,"V_SCI_DIP":108,"G_SCI_DIP":30,"V_SCI_MED":28,"G_SCI_MED":2,"V_SEC_ENG":257,"G_SEC_ENG":124,"V_SEC_DIP":363,"G_SEC_DIP":245,"V_SEC_MED":40,"G_SEC_MED":7,"V_ENG_DIP":679,"V_ENG_MED":235,"G_ENG_MED":96,"V_DIP_MED":387,"G_DIP_MED":188},"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":1043,"range_min":390,"range_max":748},"security_skill":{"core":702,"range_min":214,"range_max":482},"medicine_skill":{"core":288,"range_min":189,"range_max":427}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":653,"range_min":390,"range_max":748},"security_skill":{"core":274,"range_min":214,"range_max":482},"medicine_skill":{"core":153,"range_min":189,"range_max":427}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":679,"range_min":390,"range_max":748},"security_skill":{"core":318,"range_min":214,"range_max":482},"medicine_skill":{"core":170,"range_min":189,"range_max":427}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":757,"range_min":390,"range_max":748},"security_skill":{"core":408,"range_min":214,"range_max":482},"medicine_skill":{"core":199,"range_min":189,"range_max":427}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":893,"range_min":390,"range_max":748},"security_skill":{"core":540,"range_min":214,"range_max":482},"medicine_skill":{"core":237,"range_min":189,"range_max":427}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"Without the emotional attachment of a main cast character or an eye-popping voyage number, it's understandable that this 6-pack offering was passed over by many, but Commander Exodia bn Bem is almost as fun to use as he is to say.

Her other components are somewhat lacklustre, highlighted by a #3 gauntlet pair which, if it's that important to you, in real terms means she shares breathing room with super rare Grand Proxy Neelix, and a spot in Jury Rigger that no longer means what it used to.","action":{"bonus_amount":7,"name":"It Was Better When We Were Separate","symbol":"irina_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":12,"duration":6,"limit":2,"bonus_type":1,"crew":2817762,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_irina_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":2,"amount":25},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":455,"evasion":425,"crit_chance":70,"crit_bonus":50}},{"archetype_id":3634,"symbol":"dathon_captain_crew","name":"Captain Dathon","short_name":"Dathon","max_rarity":3,"traits":["tamarian","maverick","communicator","survivalist"],"traits_named":["Tamarian","Maverick","Communicator","Survivalist"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","male","organic","dathon","tng","captain","crew_max_rarity_3"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_dathon_sm.png","collections":["Rare Crew"],"totalChronCost":595,"factionOnlyTotal":22,"craftCost":281800,"bigbook_tier":2,"events":5,"ranks":{"voyRank":780,"gauntletRank":817,"chronCostRank":812,"B_CMD":549,"A_CMD":551,"B_SEC":360,"A_SEC":417,"B_DIP":376,"A_DIP":383,"V_CMD_SCI":808,"G_CMD_SCI":719,"V_CMD_SEC":616,"G_CMD_SEC":618,"V_CMD_ENG":797,"G_CMD_ENG":662,"V_CMD_DIP":602,"G_CMD_DIP":442,"V_CMD_MED":777,"G_CMD_MED":615,"V_SCI_SEC":714,"G_SCI_SEC":780,"V_SCI_ENG":858,"V_SCI_DIP":684,"G_SCI_DIP":566,"V_SCI_MED":843,"V_SEC_ENG":658,"G_SEC_ENG":671,"V_SEC_DIP":549,"G_SEC_DIP":537,"V_SEC_MED":646,"G_SEC_MED":642,"V_ENG_DIP":670,"G_ENG_DIP":526,"V_ENG_MED":838,"V_DIP_MED":598,"G_DIP_MED":452},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":488,"range_min":90,"range_max":212},"security_skill":{"core":475,"range_min":20,"range_max":60},"command_skill":{"core":185,"range_min":48,"range_max":122}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":373,"range_min":90,"range_max":212},"security_skill":{"core":358,"range_min":20,"range_max":60},"command_skill":{"core":124,"range_min":48,"range_max":122}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":409,"range_min":90,"range_max":212},"security_skill":{"core":406,"range_min":20,"range_max":60},"command_skill":{"core":153,"range_min":48,"range_max":122}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"“Darmok on the Voyage.

With this T'Pol, I've got to be honest with you, I didn't think that hard about it. My thought process was thus:\n\n\"She's worse than Twilight T'Pol, but better than Alternate Future T'Pol, so she goes here.\" It's rare that a crew slots so neatly into a tier based on its counterparts, but North Star T'Pol warrants it based on just how commonplace her offerings are nowadays. Same skill stack, different order (please read in the key of same shit, different day) to Pupcard, acting as an inferior, less free Tenavik, and basically being a straight upgrade to Alternate Future T'Pol with a vanity attached, make it hard to be excited about her. She's just good. And yes, that is meant to be damning with faint praise.

I've never done it, but boy have I been tempted. And Ezri is the latest in a very small line to tempt me.\n\nBoasting enough raw voyage power to outperform geezers like Koloth, though not the skill set to truly pull ahead of silver foxes like Tainer, Ezri manages to outpace even that pack thanks to lots of little tasty fringe benefits. For one, she's one of the few top shelf voyagers that you'll actually recognise at a glance (Leucon? Boothby Replicant?), meaning she grandfathers her way into a Dax-sized event count. So far, so Fancy, Dan.\n\nEzri also manages to slide into home plate with the crown of new #1 Dax SEC (stolen from the withering Mirror Jadzia), meaning she corners the market on some of the more common shuttle seats. She also comes bundled with a useable +9 Attack at 6 seconds on ships, and a hard to complete vanity with some truly despicable cards that you don't want to immortalise before her (I'd like to refer you to the excellently written Solok write-up down in the Super Rare section, I hear the author is quite handsome and well-endowed).\n\nShe does have her downsides - mediocre traits outside of Athlete, Counselor and Costumed, none of which I like the chances of, and she's still a SEC/DIP voyager at the heart of things, her MED only a sad tertiary - but numbers like these age like a fine wine, not unlike Nicole de Boer herself.

But she won't see the same kind of versatile use as someone like Ba'ul, whose rarer skill combo renders him evergreen, and her traits are outright garbage. If Disco cuts her loose, you'll probably never see her in an event again unless you're digging deep in the drawer for warm bodies to fill requisition shuttles.\n\nAs it is, we'll simply have to wait and see, so tikka seat and hope for vindaloo-cation.","action":{"bonus_amount":9,"name":"Stand Down","symbol":"nhan_evsuit_action","cooldown":8,"initial_cooldown":6,"duration":5,"bonus_type":0,"crew":3078795,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_nhan_evsuit_icon"},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":500,"evasion":450,"crit_chance":95,"crit_bonus":150}},{"archetype_id":10269,"symbol":"picard_stranded_crew","name":"Picard at El-Adrel","short_name":"Picard","max_rarity":3,"traits":["federation","starfleet","human","survivalist","communicator","diplomat","cultural_figure"],"traits_named":["Federation","Starfleet","Human","Survivalist","Communicator","Diplomat","Cultural Figure"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","tng","captain","bridge_crew","picard","crew_max_rarity_3"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_picard_stranded_sm.png","collections":["New Life and New Civilizations","Rare Crew"],"totalChronCost":1134,"factionOnlyTotal":18,"craftCost":228850,"bigbook_tier":1,"events":17,"ranks":{"voyRank":779,"gauntletRank":792,"chronCostRank":714,"B_SEC":503,"A_SEC":506,"B_DIP":325,"A_DIP":348,"B_MED":157,"A_MED":159,"V_CMD_SCI":891,"V_CMD_SEC":794,"G_CMD_SEC":710,"V_CMD_ENG":887,"V_CMD_DIP":677,"G_CMD_DIP":654,"V_CMD_MED":680,"G_CMD_MED":543,"V_SCI_SEC":787,"G_SCI_SEC":744,"V_SCI_ENG":857,"V_SCI_DIP":658,"G_SCI_DIP":633,"V_SCI_MED":582,"G_SCI_MED":369,"V_SEC_ENG":756,"G_SEC_ENG":636,"V_SEC_DIP":596,"G_SEC_DIP":542,"V_SEC_MED":529,"G_SEC_MED":372,"V_ENG_DIP":642,"G_ENG_DIP":599,"V_ENG_MED":557,"G_ENG_MED":340,"V_DIP_MED":410,"G_DIP_MED":291},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":571,"range_min":71,"range_max":167},"medicine_skill":{"core":335,"range_min":62,"range_max":178},"security_skill":{"core":215,"range_min":38,"range_max":100}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":456,"range_min":71,"range_max":167},"medicine_skill":{"core":214,"range_min":62,"range_max":178},"security_skill":{"core":154,"range_min":38,"range_max":100}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":492,"range_min":71,"range_max":167},"medicine_skill":{"core":264,"range_min":62,"range_max":178},"security_skill":{"core":183,"range_min":38,"range_max":100}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"Top DIP bases, very nice proficiency and a top 10 3* voyager.

A hefty shield regeneration ship ability and decent traits makes him finally one of the best represented Picard cards in the game.","action":{"bonus_amount":4,"name":"Darmok And Jalad On The Ocean","symbol":"picard_stranded_action","cooldown":10,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":8,"bonus_type":0,"crew":3102313,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_picard_stranded_icon"},"ability":{"condition":2,"type":6,"amount":1000},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":240,"evasion":165,"crit_chance":75,"crit_bonus":100}},{"archetype_id":12276,"symbol":"dsc_jett_reno_medic_crew","name":"Medic Jett Reno","short_name":"Reno","max_rarity":5,"traits":["starfleet","federation","human","jury_rigger","resourceful","veteran","survivalist","desperate"],"traits_named":["Starfleet","Federation","Human","Jury Rigger","Resourceful","Veteran","Survivalist","Desperate"],"traits_hidden":["female","organic","dsc","jett_reno","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_reno_medic_sm.png","collections":["Spit and Bailing Wire","Valor in Combat"],"totalChronCost":1718,"factionOnlyTotal":29,"craftCost":706400,"bigbook_tier":2,"events":21,"ranks":{"voyRank":34,"gauntletRank":208,"chronCostRank":359,"B_SCI":266,"A_SCI":280,"B_ENG":59,"A_ENG":55,"B_MED":14,"A_MED":9,"V_CMD_SCI":398,"G_CMD_SCI":624,"V_CMD_SEC":649,"V_CMD_ENG":135,"G_CMD_ENG":311,"V_CMD_DIP":679,"V_CMD_MED":29,"G_CMD_MED":97,"V_SCI_SEC":398,"G_SCI_SEC":611,"V_SCI_ENG":60,"G_SCI_ENG":126,"V_SCI_DIP":416,"G_SCI_DIP":624,"V_SCI_MED":27,"G_SCI_MED":43,"V_SEC_ENG":155,"G_SEC_ENG":330,"V_SEC_DIP":692,"V_SEC_MED":37,"G_SEC_MED":102,"V_ENG_DIP":149,"G_ENG_DIP":337,"V_ENG_MED":1,"G_ENG_MED":4,"V_DIP_MED":57,"G_DIP_MED":127},"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":1231,"range_min":220,"range_max":490},"engineering_skill":{"core":1050,"range_min":138,"range_max":312},"science_skill":{"core":489,"range_min":71,"range_max":174}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":841,"range_min":220,"range_max":490},"engineering_skill":{"core":622,"range_min":138,"range_max":312},"science_skill":{"core":264,"range_min":71,"range_max":174}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":867,"range_min":220,"range_max":490},"engineering_skill":{"core":666,"range_min":138,"range_max":312},"science_skill":{"core":288,"range_min":71,"range_max":174}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":945,"range_min":220,"range_max":490},"engineering_skill":{"core":756,"range_min":138,"range_max":312},"science_skill":{"core":333,"range_min":71,"range_max":174}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":1081,"range_min":220,"range_max":490},"engineering_skill":{"core":888,"range_min":138,"range_max":312},"science_skill":{"core":430,"range_min":71,"range_max":174}}}],"in_portal":false,"markdownContent":"There's a general rule of thumb when it comes to the truly elite crew, and while it's a slightly unscientific method, it still stands the test of time. When it comes to crew, can you look at them, and see tier 1, without having to think about it too hard? If you have to think about it, they're not tier 1. When it comes to Medic Reno, we did have to think about it, but it was a harder gut decision than most. Beating out Caretaker, the legendary Cheesecake Seven and the old faithful Leonardo da Vinci to become the new top dog MED/ENG voyager, Reno manages to out-do them all, backwards and with heels on, Ginger Rogers-style, thanks to the ultra rare MED primary, ENG secondary pairing. She also comes bundled with a number of side benefits that make for a compelling overall package - a #4 ranked ENG/MED Gauntlet pair, two stat boosting collections, a hearty MED base, and a collection of traits that may not pick up many megas, but will definitely net you some tasty AM when slotting her in for voyages. \n\nSo, why not tier 1? Well, for starters, we're in a Discovery mega holding pattern, waiting on season three to let us know if they will continue. The Picard mega 8-ball says \"Outlook cloudy, try again later\". She'll get variants, to be sure, since she's quasi-bridge crew, but it's not exactly safe to treat it as read for her to be snatching up months of bonuses anymore. Her Gauntlet pair looks more impressive than it is, given she'll be curbstomped by an old man with a banjo every time he looks at her, and her collections, while good, are far from exclusive. Just a shade off truly perfect crew. But that's nothing to sniff at, considering the company she keeps. So by all means, cite the former global gift and cross your fingers for further Discovery development.","action":{"bonus_amount":7,"name":"Body's Just A Machine...","symbol":"jett_reno_medic_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":6,"duration":10,"limit":3,"bonus_type":0,"crew":3104191,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_reno_medic_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":3,"amount":12},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":595,"evasion":215,"crit_chance":110,"crit_bonus":225}},{"archetype_id":12302,"symbol":"soji_asha_crew_crew","name":"Soji Asha","short_name":"Soji","max_rarity":5,"traits":["android","counselor","xenoanthropology","romantic","human","civilian"],"traits_named":["Android","Counselor","Xenoanthropology","Romantic","Human","Civilian"],"traits_hidden":["artificial_life","pic","female","soji","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_soji_asha_sm.png","collections":[],"totalChronCost":1573,"factionOnlyTotal":18,"craftCost":678900,"bigbook_tier":3,"events":7,"ranks":{"voyRank":35,"gauntletRank":284,"chronCostRank":540,"B_SCI":263,"A_SCI":270,"B_DIP":102,"A_DIP":114,"B_MED":7,"A_MED":7,"V_CMD_SCI":385,"G_CMD_SCI":594,"V_CMD_SEC":650,"V_CMD_ENG":617,"V_CMD_DIP":266,"G_CMD_DIP":479,"V_CMD_MED":25,"G_CMD_MED":147,"V_SCI_SEC":390,"G_SCI_SEC":586,"V_SCI_ENG":281,"G_SCI_ENG":376,"V_SCI_DIP":63,"G_SCI_DIP":166,"V_SCI_MED":24,"G_SCI_MED":64,"V_SEC_ENG":581,"V_SEC_DIP":261,"G_SEC_DIP":491,"V_SEC_MED":33,"G_SEC_MED":149,"V_ENG_DIP":164,"G_ENG_DIP":363,"V_ENG_MED":28,"G_ENG_MED":97,"V_DIP_MED":2,"G_DIP_MED":44},"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":1297,"range_min":192,"range_max":423},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":1022,"range_min":136,"range_max":294},"science_skill":{"core":498,"range_min":82,"range_max":182}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":907,"range_min":192,"range_max":423},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":574,"range_min":136,"range_max":294},"science_skill":{"core":273,"range_min":82,"range_max":182}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":933,"range_min":192,"range_max":423},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":619,"range_min":136,"range_max":294},"science_skill":{"core":297,"range_min":82,"range_max":182}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":1011,"range_min":192,"range_max":423},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":714,"range_min":136,"range_max":294},"science_skill":{"core":342,"range_min":82,"range_max":182}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":1147,"range_min":192,"range_max":423},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":853,"range_min":136,"range_max":294},"science_skill":{"core":439,"range_min":82,"range_max":182}}}],"in_portal":false,"markdownContent":"Well, here we are, the Destr - Spoiler herself.

Her event count is dismal, her traits ensure that won't get better, and she has no collection value.\n\nSo before you take Bridal Keiko as your lawfully wedded crew member, consider us the man in the back yelling \"I object!\"","action":{"bonus_amount":7,"name":"I Do!","symbol":"keiko_bride_action","cooldown":10,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":6,"limit":2,"bonus_type":1,"crew":3166858,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_keiko_bride_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":1,"amount":400},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":500,"evasion":265,"crit_chance":254,"crit_bonus":150}},{"archetype_id":12398,"symbol":"picard_sinister_crew","name":"Sinister Picard","short_name":"Picard","max_rarity":5,"traits":["human","brutal","undercover_operative","civilian","costumed","scoundrel"],"traits_named":["Human","Brutal","Undercover Operative","Civilian","Costumed","Scoundrel"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","pic","admiral","bridge_crew","picard","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_picard_sinister_sm.png","collections":[],"totalChronCost":1882,"factionOnlyTotal":28,"craftCost":614800,"bigbook_tier":3,"events":17,"ranks":{"voyRank":6,"gauntletRank":107,"chronCostRank":313,"B_CMD":74,"A_CMD":85,"B_SEC":31,"A_SEC":1,"B_DIP":402,"A_DIP":444,"V_CMD_SCI":158,"G_CMD_SCI":355,"V_CMD_SEC":1,"G_CMD_SEC":19,"V_CMD_ENG":130,"G_CMD_ENG":288,"V_CMD_DIP":118,"G_CMD_DIP":273,"V_CMD_MED":94,"G_CMD_MED":281,"V_SCI_SEC":47,"G_SCI_SEC":60,"V_SCI_ENG":433,"V_SCI_DIP":421,"G_SCI_DIP":657,"V_SCI_MED":403,"V_SEC_ENG":53,"G_SEC_ENG":54,"V_SEC_DIP":39,"G_SEC_DIP":52,"V_SEC_MED":22,"G_SEC_MED":43,"V_ENG_DIP":376,"G_ENG_DIP":625,"V_ENG_MED":356,"V_DIP_MED":318,"G_DIP_MED":538},"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":1281,"range_min":298,"range_max":601},"command_skill":{"core":1030,"range_min":152,"range_max":317},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":467,"range_min":64,"range_max":151}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":891,"range_min":298,"range_max":601},"command_skill":{"core":582,"range_min":152,"range_max":317},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":242,"range_min":64,"range_max":151}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":917,"range_min":298,"range_max":601},"command_skill":{"core":627,"range_min":152,"range_max":317},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":266,"range_min":64,"range_max":151}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":995,"range_min":298,"range_max":601},"command_skill":{"core":722,"range_min":152,"range_max":317},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":311,"range_min":64,"range_max":151}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":1131,"range_min":298,"range_max":601},"command_skill":{"core":861,"range_min":152,"range_max":317},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":408,"range_min":64,"range_max":151}}}],"in_portal":false,"markdownContent":"Why yes, he DOES look appropriately sinister, don't you agree?

And out of the darkness comes a shining angel that has made all but the most vocal Gauntlet haters giddy with anticipation. We expect the Gauntlet crew, when they come about, to have big numbers in proficiencies but Red Angel delivers the right combination of high bases and high minimum rolls to put her voyage averages straight into the Top 20 voyage crew. She sits right next to Interfaced LaForge, Leah Brahms and Honey Bare pushing them out of “must-cite” lists.\n\nCompared to other Gauntlet mainstays, she’s probably most likely to upset the walls of Locutus along the way and even take a few Caretakers down too. It’s a cascade effect as people scramble to get crew to combat the new hotness and I hope Red Angel’s inclusion into the top ranks of Gauntlet means we get to see some variation in builds as opposed to the usual motley crew of The Boggy Bartender Banjo Borg.\n\nHer trait list is somewhat insane, sporting a ton of useful features that have not only been Gauntlet bonuses for a while but are oft repeated on events. And speaking of events, she’s a Burnham and you know what that means.

And, as an added bonus, if you shy away from the brusque, premium taste of the campaign 5* Science Officer Spock, this decidedly more classic vintage of the same wine offers much the same power for a much less dear price of just a few Chronitons.","action":{"bonus_amount":9,"name":"Facilitate A Better View","symbol":"spock_evsuit_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":8,"bonus_type":2,"crew":3449319,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_spock_evsuit_icon"},"ability":{"condition":1,"type":0,"amount":4},"special":false},"ship_battle":{"accuracy":500,"evasion":150,"crit_chance":100,"crit_bonus":125}},{"archetype_id":13421,"symbol":"solok_captain_crew","name":"Captain Solok","short_name":"Solok","max_rarity":5,"traits":["vulcan","starfleet","writer","federation","telepath"],"traits_named":["Vulcan","Starfleet","Writer","Federation","Telepath"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","ds9","solok","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_solok_captain_sm.png","collections":["Live Long and Prosper"],"totalChronCost":1021,"factionOnlyTotal":40,"craftCost":625600,"bigbook_tier":7,"events":11,"ranks":{"voyRank":124,"gauntletRank":377,"chronCostRank":502,"B_CMD":97,"A_CMD":125,"B_SCI":8,"A_SCI":18,"B_SEC":361,"A_SEC":385,"V_CMD_SCI":7,"G_CMD_SCI":51,"V_CMD_SEC":136,"G_CMD_SEC":306,"V_CMD_ENG":184,"G_CMD_ENG":417,"V_CMD_DIP":301,"G_CMD_DIP":536,"V_CMD_MED":151,"G_CMD_MED":389,"V_SCI_SEC":26,"G_SCI_SEC":74,"V_SCI_ENG":100,"G_SCI_ENG":175,"V_SCI_DIP":103,"G_SCI_DIP":245,"V_SCI_MED":63,"G_SCI_MED":153,"V_SEC_ENG":379,"G_SEC_ENG":526,"V_SEC_DIP":517,"G_SEC_DIP":672,"V_SEC_MED":339,"G_SEC_MED":508,"V_ENG_DIP":665,"V_ENG_MED":412,"V_DIP_MED":589},"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":1283,"range_min":199,"range_max":400},"command_skill":{"core":1004,"range_min":95,"range_max":266},"security_skill":{"core":475,"range_min":88,"range_max":162}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":893,"range_min":199,"range_max":400},"command_skill":{"core":556,"range_min":95,"range_max":266},"security_skill":{"core":250,"range_min":88,"range_max":162}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":919,"range_min":199,"range_max":400},"command_skill":{"core":601,"range_min":95,"range_max":266},"security_skill":{"core":274,"range_min":88,"range_max":162}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":997,"range_min":199,"range_max":400},"command_skill":{"core":696,"range_min":95,"range_max":266},"security_skill":{"core":319,"range_min":88,"range_max":162}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":1133,"range_min":199,"range_max":400},"command_skill":{"core":835,"range_min":95,"range_max":266},"security_skill":{"core":416,"range_min":88,"range_max":162}}}],"in_portal":false,"markdownContent":"It's rare that a Legendary card has arguably less long term benefits than a Super Rare equivalent, but comparing the Captain of the T'Kumbra with the Captain of the Logician baseball team (seriously, how did Solok talk his crew into that?), you end up feeling like he comes up short.
