As it turns out, you WOULD like her when she’s angry. If you’re a Kes fan, enjoy this long-requested version, because unless/until DB releases Sweaty Puberty Kes, this is likely to be her last strong option for a long time to come. Luckily, she plans to go out with a bang, starting with a Captain Killy copy/paste ship ability which will always be worth its weight in Skirmish/Arena gold, no matter who it’s attached to. 

She backs that up with a rare voyage skill set that is still performing on the deck of the Titanic as her ranks sink and a few gauntlet pairs that, while buried behind heavy hitters like Armus and the Phloxes, catch bonus traits often enough to make her a useful contributor. 

Thoroughly uneventable through the game's first five years, WRG's collection renaissance has put a highlight on formerly undesirable traits and gives her room to expand in that area while maintaining value in areas where investments typically age very well - arena and gauntlet.
