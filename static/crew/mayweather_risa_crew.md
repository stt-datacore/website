Call him Delta Flyer Paris Version 2.0 - as North Face Knee Brace Mayweather is the second legendary crew to have a CMD/ENG/MED skill set, the comparison is unavoidable. Travis' raw voyage score is set to join Paris in the Power Creep Acres rest home, yet his skill set (arguably the best in the game) will keep him in service longer than the raw numbers suggest that he should. I don't know...something about workman's comp?

Mayweather is the opposite of a brand name, as evidenced by his leisurely two year hiatus from event bonuses, but at least his CMD base will earn him scattered chances to, ya know, pilot a shuttle from time to time. Beyond that, just two little traits stand between him and the bottom of the barrel.
