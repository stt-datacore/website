Like her character, Tasha's event appearances dropped off after STT's season one, but she's still 'bridge crew' with a few eventable traits to help grant her some weekend work. Her other non-collection perk is as one-star, triggerless instant damage for new players. It activates on the slow side, but is more powerful than most triggerless damage crew at her rarity level.
