Galen's daily use metrics are almost totally superfluous at this point. It's understandable given his age and it's a similar story for Picard events. Where he once shined as the best (only) SCI option for his character, Picard has been given several variants to flex his muscle, er, brain, including the former mega crew Picard and Number One. Still worth a thaw situationally, Galen spends his time these days as a part time event pilot and full time notch on the biggest stat-boosting collection in the game.
