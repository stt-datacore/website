Classic DB. There was no way they were going to let Runaway Po's reign as #1 Purple Disco ENG last longer than a hiccup. Since the comparison is there and hanging low for us already, the collections and ENG base line up, but Saru's voyage efficacy and trait set are steps down.

Still an excellent crew on his own merits and perhaps the better event bet going forward, Saru contributes two stat-boosting collections, solid base power, and good-not-great voyage work with ENG/SCI being a very common pairing. Discovery's event eligibility has been the talk around town since the show began, but until proven otherwise, it's a plus attribute for crew, provided you're not overloaded with options.

With a seemingly uneventable group of traits, you'll be looking for an uptick in variant events if the megas stop. Speculation aside, Saru is the rare collection jewel with the daily stats to back it up and certainly worth fusing if your Jury Rigger collection is incomplete.
