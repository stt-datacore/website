Lokek's event history is baffling longer than one would expect and while it seems sensible to postulate that another survivalist or Enterprise mega is unlikely, that would be mostly guesswork, as the dark art of event forecasting tends to be.

Somewhat more tangible are her set of collections, including a vanity. There are certainly worse collection/event combos out there, but if your aim is to acquire crew you can use, this Sato is buried behind hundreds of others.
