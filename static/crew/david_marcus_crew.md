Kirk's resentful son was an early adopter of the multi-collection formation, but that's become commonplace and he's since been eclipsed by a few big collection studs. Still absolutely worth immortalizing in the late game, he simply doesn't offer anything else for early-to-mid game players aside from some very spotty event work tied to bad bases.
