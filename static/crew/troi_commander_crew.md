MED/CMD on the behold screen is sure to elicit a Bateman-esque 'Oooo', but the power lets Troi down big time. Voyages in the early game and low power bonus pilot in the mid-game are options due to her skill set and brand name, but hit like a wiffle bat compared to many other options. Her best bet for employment is a pair of 45% gauntlets where she can leverage that rare skill set into some 2-for-1 victories.
