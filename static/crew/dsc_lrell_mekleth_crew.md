With Disco's dominance having seemingly vanished, L'Rell is left with scant value, most of it coming from her short trait list. The best argument for her in a behold is ironically that she’s so vanilla, you cannot guarantee a retrieval combination for her. She may snag a couple collections when it’s all said and done, but L’Rell should only be an option for endgame rosters who have no holes.
