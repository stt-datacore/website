A clear pattern is beginning to emerge amongst the Strange New Worlds crew we've gotten so far, with Pike and Spock coming out swinging for the top two voyager slots, while recent six pack stunner Chapel and fan favourite master of the Vulcan slapdown Doctor M'Benga are left to pick up the scraps. The good doctor's skill set is a plus, but it's harder to justify the investment when he's debuting where his capricious Caitian counterpart T'Ana will be in a year - an ENG kicker, easily justified by spoilery things and his well earned Jury Rigger trait, would have made him a more enticing proposition, but we have what we have. For most rosters, this is a card to be pursued only in the name of love - if you're a fan of the character, then the Big Book strongly recommends saving the resources you'd otherwise spend, and waiting for a slightly less bland, slightly more Elysian variant which is sure to come sooner rather than later.
