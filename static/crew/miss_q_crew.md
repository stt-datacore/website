"Fan favorite Suzie Plakson" is all some people need to hear, but let's go over her gameplay considerations anyways.

Suzie Q is usable on voyages for a while longer, though she likely won't unseat your influx of fused event super rares until she herself is immortalized. Event work is somewhat tricky to forecast as well - her bases are fine to thaw with a bonus, but her traits have mostly provided events in spurts thus far and she could easily be the victim of bonus droughts at any time.

The safety blanket fallback here is her collection value. All bets have been off since Resourceful hit, so even her larger traits like Crafty are in play and make her a must-have to fill in the collection stat boosts as your roster ages and you graduate to legendary crew to staff all of your away teams.
