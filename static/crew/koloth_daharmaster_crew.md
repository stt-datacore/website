Trelane's alter ego, once deadly serious, is sliding down the ranks towards the Squire’s jokester status. A stellar power option on release, Koloth’s bat’leth has been blunted by age, leaving him middling in areas where he used to excel.

The CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set, perennially flooded with options, has always needed powerful numbers to keep up with the rest of the field on voyages. Now a trait matching bit player at best, Koloth is more of a “stars align” option there and in the gauntlet where his absurd number of 45%+ trait sets are accompanied by proficiency power more at home on new players’ rosters. A plus trait set overall does leave him in retrieval contention for veteran players, however, thanks to a healthy collection ceiling and intermittent event work. Koloth is a well-rounded character whose past days of honor and glory were a sight to behold.
