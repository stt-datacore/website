All-Terrain Burnham is her first gauntleteer variant and helps flesh out a well-rounded STT character. She parlays a top five SEC proficiency into two respectably ranked gauntlet pairs; both close enough to catch #1 sleeping if she brings a crit advantage. Despite numbers heavily tilted toward proficiencies, her SEC base is tops for a character who's always a threat to pick up fistfuls of events.

Weak, but adequate voyage numbers play well because of her rare-ish skill set and keep her in the top five SEC/SCI names for voyages. First Officer Burnham may hog the headlines, but the ATB can take you anywhere you want to go.
