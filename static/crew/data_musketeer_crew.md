When a lot of players look at Data, they might see a 2-skiller with nothing fancy about him besides his fantastic outfit, but Muskie's better than that. Niche (read:new player) arena accuracy meets a SEC base mere points off the lead for super rare Datas for spot work on early-to-midgame rosters.

But as a one stop collection shop, Musketeer Data may not have hit his peak yet. Triple stat-boosting collections, four out of five additional traits which very well could get lucky, and maybe an outside shot at a whimsical vanity collection. Even players who are looking for consistent, daily usage from their super rare crew should devote the roster space to collect copies.
