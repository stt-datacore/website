Aces in most areas of the game. The #2 and 3 DIP proficiency rolls behind her belong to voyage exclusives and her voyage/voyage DIP numbers are stellar. A healthy +8 arena EV at 4 seconds will help thwart almost any instant damage crew in the arena. You can knock her for poor bases, but she has the chance to pitch in on Faction events and brings a tremendous amount of daily use value to the table.
