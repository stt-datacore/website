TKK’s gauntlet goodness is a hair off the unholy trinity of a few previous exclusives, mostly due to a lack of raw proficiency power, but there’s still plenty to love here. The first SEC primary gauntlet exclusive may not have the top roll for that skill, but their supplementary skills blow the likes of Tiny Tert Gangster Spock and the All-Terrain Burnham out of the water. With plenty of elevated crit gauntlets and competitive rolls in the decidedly uncompetitive CMD/ENG pair, TKK slots in nicely as yet another exclusive to do it all.

Like most gauntlet crew, abhorrent bases sink their voyage and shuttle work, but the card is otherwise redeemed. The most valuable collection spot in the game joins several others to make TKK a must-have crew for late game players looking to stack skill boosts. They have a handful of other untapped traits saved for a rainy day and will certainly tempt unlucky gauntlet-goers stuck in citation temptation.

Both interesting and usable is their shipboard ability. Big instant damage and a desirable attack boost are tempered by a hair-slow trigger and huge evasion handicap. Theoretically this crew could save you from citing up another attack boost arena option, but you have to ask yourself one question. Do you feel lucky, punk? Well…do ya?
