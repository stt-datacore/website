A thick, rich, lush trait portfolio is oftentimes what veteran players look for in non-legendary crew. They're the engine of thawpertunities for events and possible future collections. In this case, for a crew whose daily work prospects are bleak for a card his age, traits comprise the bulk of Starling's value for everyone. Resourceful wasn't the most likely of his many traits to hit on the Collection Wheel, but it's probably not the last. When in doubt, just take a page from the Starling Vocal Band's smash hit, Collection Delight.

Thinkin' traits is workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little Collection delight
Rubbin' Borgs and Qs together makes the sparks ingite
And the thought of citin' crew is getting so exciting
Ne-ver behold Cartwright
Collection delight
