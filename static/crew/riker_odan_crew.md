Traits have become the lifeblood of Timelines, but just because Riker's have been simmering for a while and haven't been feasted on yet doesn't mean that they aren't delicious.

A handful of non-HFS traits have yet to bloom, which has left him out of the collection party and they haven't helped support an otherwise strong Riker event portfolio either. The one spot that they have been putting in work is on voyages. A half dozen anti-matter traits including the rarer Maverick and Gambler tags do boost his credentials there a little bit, but every time you turn around there's another CMD/DIP/SCI to acquire.

If you weren't here for Surak, then chances are you were here for Tenavik. If you weren't here for Tenavik, then chances are you were here for the global gift of Mambo Picard. And if you weren't here for Mambo Picard, then you were probably here for Humanoid Figure! And if you weren't here for Humanoid Figure, then chances are very good you were here for Picard and Number One! And if you weren't here for Picard and Number One! ... Then who's driving the plane?!
