It's a little hard to get the Vahots for this particular Kelpien stud when he's essentially a remixed version of the really rather good Soji that everyone's getting a 4/5 copy of at the moment, but bear with me and let me tell you why you should at least look his way.

For one thing, MED is always worth stacking, and while we here at the Big Book are often the first to tell you not to care about a big common base like Saru's DIP primary, that doesn't mean you shouldn't still collect them where you can. This is also a skill set that you don't often see for main cast variants, especially not a SCI heavy character like Saru, so for future Faction events, he'll give you a definite edge.

He may not have particularly excellent traits, and he's barely ranked in the Gauntlet, but I suspect that most rosters will find themselves using him more than they think so long as they don't expect any heroics. It's crew like this that will form a strong backbone on your roster, and if you find yourself looking at your line-up in a few months, wondering why you're mysteriously short of DIP, it's because you can't just shoot for the amazing cards - you have to have a few just very good ones, too.
