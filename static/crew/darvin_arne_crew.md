Swimming in Traits like his alter ego Barry, one naturally follows to Collections (Big checkmark with more possibilities down the line). Arne's great Skill set is saddled with a slew of low-power Voyage options and could be a key component of a monster Voyager some day when paired with Traits like his. Unfortunately, Arne *is* one of the low-power options so even though he punches above his weight class, he's already been Power Crept into irrelevance on Voyages.

When considering weekend work, Darvin is Mega Man. Four previous months of bonus have struck along with a handful of standalone Events. His bases are dated and won't ride without a bonus, but The Great Material Trait Continuum will provide him with enough chances in the future to help you out on Shuttles. 

Moist, flavorful dressing with buttery rolls and impeccable cranberry sauce. But the Turkey is mostly skin and bones.
