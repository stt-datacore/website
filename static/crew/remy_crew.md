Hey!

Remy Remy, who can I turn to?
You’re an Orion, I can hold on to.
I know you're better than most of the others before.
We saw their trait and stat numbers on the floor.
Remy, you’ve got trait numbers,
I need to make you mine.
Remy, such great traits numbers,

Eight six *SEVEN* five three or nine?
Eight six *SEVEN* five three or nine?

Remy Remy, you're the guy for me.
Irish Orion, you make me so happy.
I’ll try to earn a copy, if I have the nerve.
More effort than CMD/DIP/Suck, should ever deserve.
Remy, I love trait numbers,
I need to make you mine.
Future Collection numbers?

For your trait list, for trait list I will call!
