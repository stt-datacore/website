Here comes Gunnery Sgt De Lancie with another Q variant to get the cadets into line. He is hard, you will not like him. The more you hate him, the more you will learn! He didn’t make any effort to get to the top of the DIP ranks. If WRG wanted him up there they would have miracled his ass up there.

We can’t really muster up too much excitement for another CMD/DIP/SUCK voyage print rolling off the production line, even if his surface level score would play with different skill sets. This is more of an event piece, but with regrettably fewer traits than is standard for most de Lancie crew. True to life, Marine is one of hundreds of crew who have *checks notes* bases and traits and so should at least have his turn piloting weekend shuttles or filling collection spots, but won’t resemble anything like a standout performer on any roster.

So without further ado, we send Q off to the “Big Book Home Of Redundant Skill Sets” with a five gun salute and Nova Squadron performing some impressive aerial displays. Ten-hut!
