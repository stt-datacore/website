Some of us had posters of Kelly Kapowski or Rachel Green hanging in our bedrooms. Others had Jadzia Dax. If you're the latter, this is the crew that you want. There's no point in quibbling about which variant has the best bases when you have the event prowess and popularity that Dax does. Her voyage work is satisfactory and her collection spot irreplaceable. Finally we can feel good about spending citations on a vanity collection crew.
