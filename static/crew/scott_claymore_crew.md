Believe it or not, Claymore on release was damn near a love letter to Jimmy Doohan after years of trash variants and zero event play. But that scant attention paid and scanterer trait set had the writing on the wall the whole time. (It said 'REDRUM')

Every corner of this card is an attribute met with "but he has something else going for him, right?" His big ENG base hurts for general seating and event bonuses, an ENG-led skill set no longer has good voyage power behind it, and his collection which may be pluralized down the line is likely to stop at two. You may use him once he's fully fused, but not often and not to breathtaking results.
