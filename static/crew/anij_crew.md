The previous iteration of Anij’s note had her chances pegged on a Romantic mega, and while she may have sat and waited patiently, bagel in one hand and a book on the space Amish in the other, her number was never called. Instead, Caregiver is her route to . . . semi-relevance, making perhaps your second line of shuttles depending on your roster. She was never going to be an event name with bases and traits like these, so you’re much better off using her in Gauntlet, where she still holds a serviceable pair, or, frankly, not at all. No wonder she wants to stop time so bad, she knows she’s going into the freezer ASAP.
