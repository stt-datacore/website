From the episode that launched a thousand spin-offs, Mirror, Mirror Chekov is the kind of crew who fits his on-screen role satisfyingly well.

A failed assassination attempt on Kirk (not enough Judo chopping) and a brief vacation in the Agony Booth during his sixty seconds of fame translates into sixty seconds of usability for the average of one Chekov Faction per year he'll be thawed for. It wouldn’t be the first time we’re wrong, but color us skeptical about seeing his rate of Trait Events maintain in the future.

With Super Rare Collection value ballooning monthly and Chekov’s ceiling there extremely low, Mirror is a low floor, average ceiling freezer fodder crew overall and not worth much investment early-to-midgame.
