With Nog falling out of voyage contention, weâ€™re primarily eyeing his collection count which, barring a show mega, seems to have hit its ceiling. As for events and the chance to utilize Nog's workable ENG base - the optimist would say that we haven't had a Ferengi mega yet, the pessimist would say that he's only had one variant event in nearly three years. So...is the safe half empty or half full?
