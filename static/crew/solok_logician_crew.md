Dry as Vulcan' would be a little too on the nose here and not entirely true anyways. Solok's big CMD base is worth thawing for his yearly handful of events and with already three collection home runs on the board, there's locked-in long term value here. It remains to be seen if WRG ever says anything other than "Eh, just use Vulcan" for the Telepath trait, but Solok should still be a fine mid-to-low end freezer bound crew who can save you from much worse behold options.
