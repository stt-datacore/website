The above ranks spell out limited use, but the bulk of her value is in the gauntlet. A #4 ranked SCI proficiency and #2 SCI/ENG pair have earned her a reputation of reliability since the advent of the gauntlet, but back-to-back Gauntlet exclusives (Caretaker/Armus) have put a big dent in her value. Though she sports a healthy event count and the #2 variant ENG, her bases are overall poor and generally not worth adding stars to. Where she looks to recoup some of her value is in the arena. Twelve seconds is on the slow side nowadays, but 2700 combined crit rating and 1750 passive accuracy is a nice chunk of stats worth considering.
Global gift Seven in Silver debuted and passed her top two (terrible) bases for events. Our long nightmare continues as The Caretaker is reintroduced into the gauntlet exclusives reward cycle and two new crew have topped her SCI proficiency including Yar-eating blob Armus. With poor base and voyage numbers, she's trending more toward Dr. Daystrom than one star wonder.
