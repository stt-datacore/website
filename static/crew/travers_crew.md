As Tawny Travers would say, “I have one seat on this lousy voyage…it’s stupid, but I’m gonnna use it!”

MED/DIP generally doesn’t hurt for options on voyages and Travers, sandwiched between more available names like Cornwell and Bartender Guinan, doesn’t have a ton of room to maneuver as her unboosted score rank plummets. An exception, the saboteur anti-matter trait, should continue to win the favor of voyage calculators for a while longer, but as an investment from the ground up, you can surely find better power options.

With scant utility otherwise and a primary skill that rarely gets ample event seating, Alicia’s value will fall fast and fall hard once she stops pitching in on your voyages.
