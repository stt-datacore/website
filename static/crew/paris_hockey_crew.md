Paris' tier hinges primarily on his fantastic collection value. He's an automatic immortalize for late game players, but can easily be eschewed for those of you just starting out thanks to his lack of cadet eligibility and limited early game utility. If he *is* one of your first leveling projects, you'll at least be able to lockpick a few nodes across the galaxy map missions thanks to his fairly generous trait set.
