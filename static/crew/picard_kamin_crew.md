Hailing from perhaps one of the best episodes of Trek ever, it’s too bad WRG didn’t see fit to make Kamin Picard more useful, even on release. Years later, Kamin is DOA on Voyages and has a Trait list thinner than his hair, granting only two Collections and two more Traits unlikely to hit Collection paydirt. You’re left with Picard variant Events as his value, and while Picard would seem to be a blue-chip name for the weekends, he doesn’t get the Faction love that some others do. Grab Kamin if you love his episode, or if you’re just collecting all the Kataan in the game, but don’t expect much in terms of utility.
