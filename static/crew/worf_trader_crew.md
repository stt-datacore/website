Somewhat fittingly, Trader Worf lacks any semblance of power. His bases aren't daily use material, but do match up nicely with an impressive Worf/Klingon event count that's well into double-digits. Aside from occasional Faction event help, Trader offers a chunk of attack and crit bonus at six seconds in the arena; fast enough to pair with most damage abilities.

With a pair of post-release trait additions to pump up his collection value too, there’s enough meat on the bone to justify a low end behold stab from time to time on your way to finishing the exclusive Tribbled collection.
