There was a time when a big base meant nothing for Archer variants - he was the forgotten captain. DBWRG has since rectified that error and Bakula has accumulated multiple event bonuses for five years running. With splashes of mega relevance for this fairly trait-y crew, Carcher (more of a driving joke. I guess you had to watch ENT) will have opportunities aplenty to put his impressive base metrics to work.

Somewhat taking a back seat (haha more car puns) is Archer’s strong collection profile. He’s a high floor, high ceiling option whose overall usability should endure thanks to his strong SEC base debut, even if his voyage shelf life is a bit more modest.
