The first Rare Disco Card!  Black Alert!  In the upper suits of timelines rosters CMD/DIP is a common occurrence but down in the F2P realms Pike is sweet relief. His CMD base puts him in the top 5 Rare crew and his average stat (important for voyaging) is only beaten by Klingon Dukat. A viable replacement for Jazz Musician Riker and extremely essential for CMD/DIP voyages. What keeps him from the top tier is a lack of unique traits and an unremarkable ship ability however at the point where you need him, that won't matter. Get him on every ship and shuttle you can send!
