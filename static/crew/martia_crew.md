Move over B'Elanna, we have a new definition of volatile. Martia erupted for _three consecutive_ mega events in mid-2019 to tredecuple (I looked it up) her event count. Her trait melange, which should include Brutal for the build cost, may have room for even more, but we're talking about a crew who was valuable for one of the 146 prior weekends and offers zero daily utility. If you want to be forward thinking in your roster building, Martia is fine as a ticking trait bomb choice against other bad options, but should never be a behold priority.
