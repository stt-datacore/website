The Romulan mega (and subsequent standalone event) came and went, leaving Shinzon high and dry. In fact, with only four traits, two of them the esoteric Clone and Reman, the only possible chance for his awful bases to find work would seem to be a stray Villain (mega) event. CMD/DIP/SEC crew already have a hard enough time finding voyage work and as the second worst voyage total with that skill set, Shinzon comes up empty there too.

His only real use is as arena damage. His passives are fairly strong, but a weak attack boost and a 14 second initialization time means that you'll need to pull off some trickery to survive that long and it can't be by cloaking, which he needs as an activator. Good luck.
