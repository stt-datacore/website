Another variant, another bland Pavel to Chekoff the list. Not quite Walter Koenig's worst crime against fashion (we're still waiting on Search for Spock pink romper suit Chekov), this tan Tactician's trait set is as inoffensive and unexciting as most of his characterâ€™s appearances. Except for the Russian jokes. Gotta love them Russian jokes.

Fittingly, he can't even lay claim to being the #1 Chekov base for any skill, possessing less security than the unarmed Dancing version and less command than waporising First Officer.

With extremely thin collection value in tow, the Leftenant will be headed straight to the freezer if your roster is more than a few months old, to be thawed once or twice per year, depending how the powers that be are feeling about the original 'someone's got to be the ensign' Trek archetype.
