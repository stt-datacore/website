Before the likes of Braxton and EV Picard, the CMD/ENG ranks of the gauntlet were the purples' playground. You can see the remnants of that if you take Tucker with his 45% gauntlet and wait for the skills to line up just right, though doing so is not a recommended exercise past the beginning stages of your roster.

A few yearly events might trigger a thaw for Charles, but you're most likely after him for collections. He's probably very close to his maximum potential there (and lucky to have snagged one from a trait that didn't even exist in evsuit), but that doesn't mean he's not still worth beholding.
