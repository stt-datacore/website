Somewhere out there, Dougherty and Ross are doing the Spiderman pointing meme as we speak. They're not just cut from the same cloth, they cuddle up together under that cloth at night. By the way, if you're looking for the Gauntlet-y one, that's Admiral Owen Paris. I know, I mix them up too. The secondary antagonist from Insurrection should be at best a secondary Behold choice unless he adds an additional Collection slot.
