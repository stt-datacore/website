EV Pike's SEC leads the way here - tops for super rares and paired with some plus traits that should grant him bonuses in the wake of Discovery megas. The name Pike has a future as bright as any other due to Strange New Worlds, making him a likely event piece and possible dupe candidate. SEC and “CMD and SEC” seats litter the majority of events and his power + skill eligibility should have him at the top of every thaw list for which he has a bonus.

Serviceable on voyages despite a crowded skill set and holding down a handful of collection spots, Pike is peak long-term value and shouldn't have much trouble finding Faction action down the line.
