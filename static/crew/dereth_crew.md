It's not a Phage, mom! MED/SEC and SEC/SCI have floated near the bottom of most players’ voyage combo estimates for a long time, which is why Dereth can still be utilized there, despite poor power and abysmal anti-matter traits. That being said, voyages also comprise the bulk of his value and so if you’re looking at investing from star one, it may be too late to utilize his creepy lung teleporting medical knowledge.
New players could find spot work in the gauntlet for this second rate Defensive Phlox, while most players will be heard muttering, “at least he has collections” when facing the prospect of taking Dereth in an otherwise poor behold. There’s a little bit of everything packed into this card, but not in amounts that make him stand out in any respect.
