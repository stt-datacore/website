F. Murray Abraham's hateable perS'ona (still) owns the top ENG base in the game, but contributes next to nothing in the arena, gauntlet, or voyage tabs. A handful of traits give him some wiggle room on possible future weekend bonuses, though he doesn't always need them as he's adept at holding down a Faction seat for events with thin bonus pools. That can be a useful job, but ENG doesn't enjoy the ubiquitous shuttle seating that Captain Tribble or Professor Sato do.

All this is not to say that Ru'afo is a bad card. Just be aware that he's not high utility and has had years to build a reputation as a former mega crew. His collection value is adequate to help you break any ties if you're not sure about going in on 'shuttle crew', but his elite base and safety cushion collections still make him a fine crew to behold.
