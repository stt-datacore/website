How many top ten voyage Picards is too many? Maybe that owl from the Tootsie Pops commercial can tell us.

From just about every angle, 2024 Picard is a crew worth acquiring. Voyages are the crown jewel; his skill set is rarer than you think and his skill order consists of him and one other name in the top 300 ranks by raw score. Throw in his half dozen anti-matter traits and you’re looking at a name you’ll be using long after the year 2024.

Picard’s event clip has been extremely consistent, if not robust, and his handful of traits threaten to supplement that tally at any moment. With a top ten base on debut, Picard will have no issue commanding seats on the weekend or even day to day. Front-loaded collection value and a usable shipboard attack boost have him checking boxes in just about every corner possible except gauntlet. If you haven’t uncovered the subtext by now: cite his last star.
