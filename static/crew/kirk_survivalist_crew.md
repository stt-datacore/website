True to his on-screen performance, this Kirk has cobbled together every useful part of a card and created a cannon of a crew. Collection? Check. Multiple ranked Gauntlet pairs, strong skirmish ability, good voyage numbers? Check, check, check. The crafty Kirk has picked the perfect character to be a proficiency crew for because he's the only variant with SCI or ENG. Which means that, barring other featured crew, he'll have a ~400 ENG and ~900 SCI lead over the best non-bonus options for Kirk event shuttles. Great news, since ten of Kirk's twelve events have been Factions. If you want to collect the best variant of each character and have your bases covered (pardon the pun) for events, Survivalist Kirk is the easiest choice you can make.
Survivalist Kirk's unique event situation was on full display during a March Faction event in which he was the only bonus SCI crew for an event with fourteen SCI seats. He was the best SCI option for the event even at 1/5 and, when fused, had an 889 point lead over the #1 SCI base in the game. That sort of impact is repeatable in the future as the only Kirk option with SCI or ENG.
