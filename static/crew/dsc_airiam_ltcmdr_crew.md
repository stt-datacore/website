One of the more mediocre Disco crew unless you have a particularly fledgling roster, Airiam does at least contribute +1 Engineered and a snappy Attack boost at four seconds, as well as the relatively uncommon SCI/CMD stack. This bionic bod will do just fine on voyages and the occasional event, but she may be an intermittent thaw once sheâ€™s discovered your vault.
