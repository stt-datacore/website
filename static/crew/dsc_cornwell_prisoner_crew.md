Corny was the prototypical powerhouse MED crew and songs are still sung of her deeds, but "Eyes open, Veer" when approaching her as a project from the ground up. Voyages remain her best area of contribution - despite a raw score rank now in the triple digits, her MED-led skill set will outperform the surface numbers.

The rest of this card doesn't offer us terribly much, though, and probably won't live up to the heroics she performed at 5/5 on rosters back in 2018. Corny's modest combination of immediate and potential collections can be matched by most crew and her bases don't stand out in any regard. A reasonable crew to take behold stars on thanks to her strong debut power, but not a card who should be eating citations when power creep is printing plainly stronger cards.
