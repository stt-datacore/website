A brutally stubby trait list somehow still nets the gauntlet-focused Antaak over a dozen elevated crit sets there. His 65% gauntlet in particular may have some players re-evaluating their policy on 2-skillers, but even if most veterans will keep him frozen, he’s a great one star honeypot for new players. With most legendary MED gauntleteers offering little else outside of the gauntlet, Antaak can be a dollar store alternative to get you through the early game.

Any of Antaak’s attributes which rely on his base power are dead on arrival (except his Klingon event feature that had 90% SCI and MED seats…what the hell) and his collection profile is pretty svelte. If you won’t benefit from his gauntlet proficiency, take your time in acquiring this decidedly new player crew.
