Some on-paper contributions in the way of (cloak triggered) crit bonus or Sunday cadet eligibility are better left to crew who have broader usability than this CMD/DIP/SEC also-ran. You really should only be leveling him for the great kollection spot, which takes a few dozen faction items, but is light on chronitons.
