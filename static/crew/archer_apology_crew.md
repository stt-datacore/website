Card art showing Scott Bakula's frontula (someone fan me) comes from the episode where Archer's a total dick. Haha, like that narrows it down.

Still a fine daily use option, Humbled is viable in the gauntlet, on shuttles, and on voyages. His formerly #2 DIP base is competitive enough with everyone not named Sato or Saru and should find some daily use in between his streaky event bonuses.

One of the best skill sets for a DIP primary helps out on voyages as well. His half dozen anti-matter traits and splash of MED/CMD should have him making a handful of different combos there for a while longer. And that same rare skill stack pans out in the gauntlet where he's a mid-level option who new players especially will appreciate.

One would assume that his handful of viable traits will catch a collection or three over time and help offset any stat rank droopage to keep him in contention as a strong behold choice.
