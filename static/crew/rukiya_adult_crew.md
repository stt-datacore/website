The appellation “Adult” suggests that there exists somewhere in the vast space of our universe a pupal and larval state of Rukiya. *X-Files theme crescendos*

A decidedly lackluster debut brings to mind memories of Rukiya’s childhood, or thereabouts. During her infancy, names that share her skill set like Boothby and Tainer were popping off on voyages and Soji Asha was a delicious voyager gift from WRG. So while she sits in the rumble seat, cruising down the highway alongside them, she’s missed out on the roaring 20s that the rest of them enjoyed.

Serviceable is the best descriptor here; solid voyage power for her skill set and a heady MED base rank on release are the surface level ranks which catch eyeballs. But the supporting numbers here are flaccid at best - only three anti-matter traits, three past event bonuses, and three potential collections. 

We've been seeing the number three all over this card. On consoles, in a poker game. To date we have encountered two thousand eighty-five conspicuous examples of the number three. All of these threes can't be coming up by accident. Maybe somebody's trying to tell us something.
