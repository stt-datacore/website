Let's face it - you've gotta be a man to wear tights. Especially with this kind of confidence. But as your mother may have taught you, confidence isn't everything. He shouldn't be making too many voyages any longer and since he's a complete non-starter when it comes to Gauntlet and arena, this Littlest of Johns is first and foremost event crew.

That's no bad thing, especially as the top SEC option for his character - his down year would be a career year for Scotty. But with thin trait options for further bonuses or collections, his ceiling is limited, even if he's already met most of his potential.
