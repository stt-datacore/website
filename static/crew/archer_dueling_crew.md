Ushaan Archer is a launch card - and all that goes along with that. Needless to say his stats are a relic, but does he have anything else in the tank?

Ushaan's probably most useful to the brand new account. With his first star he offers a handful of node unlocks, most notably the Pilot/SEC node in the Celestial Temple, and some introductory gauntlet work. His SEC roll just barely still qualifies to be called 'formidable' while his dozen elevated crit gauntlets (one 45%) and ability to 2-for-1 a lone SEC or ENG roll will make many gauntlets in your first few months in the game.

Veteran players are looking at a trait-supplemented, reasonable event clip and a trio of traits which could all become collections out of nowhere. Ushaan clearly lacks for power, but not necessarily utility and makes a hell of a bridge crew photo op next to Ushaan Shran.
