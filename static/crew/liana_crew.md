That’s it, that’s the note.

Well…if you’re not a fan yet, Picard’s second season might convert you, who knows? Let’s bump the gums a minute about Liana’s skill set for voyages. A few months prior to her release, you had Scapegoat as Lord Mayor of Party Town in the ENG/SEC/DIP triplet with Ishan Sisko hanging out there and then a drop off the Cliffs of Insanity. It’s since been fleshed out stunningly often (and has us theorizing about WRG’s card creation practices), but is still a generally fine skill set overall.

Which is great news for Liana, a card that doesn’t have much else going for her. A trait set that’s about average in other areas will probably have her bases living from mega to mega while a modest collection profile is at the mercy of WRG’s dartboard for value expansion. Without “later losers” top shelf power or broader utility, Liana isn’t exactly a slam dunk for throwing cash down the Tuesday pack dilhole. But if season 8 Renee Walker isn’t reason enough to open a few packs, then we can’t be friends.
