Was this the way you thought Tuesday Packs would roar back into Timelines after an extended absence?  With a mediocre Super Rare?  Well, if you did, you’d be right!

With her Street Fighter™ fighting pose, Amanda Cole is the second non-Mirror Universe MACO in the game, and the first one since cadet Private S. Money, who was released essentially at launch seven years ago.  This author might have preferred Steven Culp’s Major J. Hayes or Daniel Dae Kim’s Corporal Chang as the next inclusion from the United Earth military detachment to Enterprise, but at least Cole had a storyline that didn’t include getting into a fistfight with Manhood Threatened Reed (new variant coming soon).  She even got a mention as Phlox’s eventual wife in the alternate timeline episode which featured Captain Lorian.

Perhaps best known for sharing a "Romantic" Vulcan neuropressure scene with Trip Tucker and then T’Pol, at least she has the trait to match? Nothing explains the erroneous Federation and Starfleet trait inclusions however, as she is decidedly neither. With only Resourcesful accounted for in the Collection ranks so far, here's to hoping for Duelist and Romantic to hit one day (which seems likely given WRG's penchant for larger ones).

Cole has standard 2022-2023 Super Rare voyage power, debuting in the top 30, and since WRG seems to have shied away from giving her CMD/DIP/SEC in any permutation, she gets an ENG secondary to go with her big SEC base (top 10 at time of release).

Elderly players may want Cole for her collection potential which is unfortunately somewhat slim, and new players could find some use for her on voyages if fused up.  Boy, Tuesday packs are back, and how!
