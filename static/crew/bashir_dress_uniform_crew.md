Welcome to Star Trek Timelines, where the points are made up and the traits don’t matter - or just don’t make sense. Despite being on Section 31 business at the time, he doesn’t count for either that faction or as an undercover operative, which is something of a shame.

That being said, a respectable event tally and the usual Engineered/Physician Bashir collections still make for an extensive portfolio. For early to mid game rosters for whom this combination of skills is a little rarer, he could glom onto some voyages with the appropriate number of stars, but even as a long term project, he's worth fusing when possible.
