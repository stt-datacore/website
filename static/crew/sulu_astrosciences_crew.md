Long time players might recall Astro's hilarious introduction to the game via a 10,000 dil buy-in weekday pack. He's been disappointing players who paid that amount every day since.

A respectable SCI proficiency might trick players into taking him for the gauntlet and while he can edge out a few wins at 45% crit, his other proficiencies are miniscule and the CMD/DIP/SCI skill set has an avalanche of competition. A couple events per year and average collection value for a legendary crew finish off the outline for what is one in a long line of disappointing Sulu variants.
