What used to be an oddity is now forefront; a trait list longer than his baguettes. Creepy uncle Neelix (don't look directly into his eyes) may have the last laugh once WRG's collection push is all said and done. The first domino to fall was the very unlikely Resourceful collection and with ten other traits of varying viability, he may begin slowly creeping his way up players' crew retrieval boards.

His pair of 1k+ bases are even fine for weekend shuttle work and though Neelix isn't an event juggernaut, he'll still pop a bonus now and then and it's baffling how few of his traits have provided a bonus to date - something else which should improve. Delivering only the essentials of life to the good folks of tier 10, it's easy to see a big (eco-friendly bike) path to improvement for this card in the future.
