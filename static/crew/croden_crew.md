As of the writing of this note, Croden is the best Rakhari in the game!

Ok, obligatory joke about one-off racial crew out of the way, let's talk about Croden.  He hails from early Deep Space Nine in an Odo-centric episode.  I can almost hear Odo's trademark harrummmph as I think back to their scenes together.

In Croden's favor is his stalwart introductory voyage power among Super Rares as well as four solid voyage antimatter seats.  If you're still using Super Rares on voyages, he may find some seats until you fill out your Legendary roster.  On ships, he may find some use as a +9 attack boost, with a strong 10s duration.

Where Croden falls short... is almost everywhere else.  Gauntlet?  Near-zero viability.  Collections?  None at the time of this writing... but wait!  5 traits that are collection-viable means he could be a lower-round sleeper pick that could pay off months or years down the road for you.  Would be nice to have seen Croden get the Criminal trait in addition to Prisoner, but the logic of traits eludes us all, it seems.
