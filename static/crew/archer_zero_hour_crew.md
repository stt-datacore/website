So is it a cop out when the developers can’t think of a better name for a crew, so they just use the episode title?  It might be, but however you feel about the Xindi Arc or Star Trek Enterprise in general, it’s nice to see ol’ Jon get a recurring Mega Event Legendary during his show’s mega arc.

Zero Hour Archer notably has more than zero Collections, but not many more than that (2 at release), with 3 more goldilocks traits for future inclusions as WRG feels fit to add new ones monthly.  As with most crew these days, he’s got a big base (SEC this time) so he’ll pitch in on weekend shuttles not only when he’s paged to event bonus duty, but without a bonus as well.

The art is stirring, as Archer is about to remotely detonate Commander Dolim into a bloody mist, so we have to ask ourselves, is Archer stirring enough as a Mega Event Legendary worth a 5th star?

WRG’s Warp 9.975 Power Creep™ seems to be slowing lately, so Archer may not lose as much voyage power as quickly as he would have if he’d been released 6 months ago, but it also means that a lot of the extremely strong crew released in the last 18 months are about to hit the Time Portal.  Better than VOY-rank 100 used to mean citeable, but it’s hard to predict where the wind is blowing now.  Let’s just throw around the term aggressively average for fun, shall we?
