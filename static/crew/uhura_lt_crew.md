Fro-get what years of stomach-churning Uhura variants have taught you - this version is actually not bad. Capable bases, hitting on five of five traits for anti-matter, even some impressive collection value for a trait list this short.

The downsides are obvious; skill set, limited event chances, and "Afro Pick Sold Separately!", but you can only ding a crew so much who fulfills the most potential that her limitations would allow. If you collect the requisite number of stars, she's guaranteed value for you, even if she promises not to age as well as her namesake.
