In our discussions of Burnham Senior, a few names came up - Tilly, Jett Reno, Stamets, all the attendant and relevant ENG/SCI names when it comes to Disco events. At first glance, Burnmom seems cut along the same cloth, correct? Big bases, that wonderful Disco event count . . . but hold on. Let me bring up another name, who you might be less familiar with, but who might hold a more accurate portent of Burnham Senior’s future.

Lt. j.g. Palmer. Another promising young woman with a massive base and no real promise outside of some traits that you could pin some vain hopes on, Gabby shares more with her than any of the other Disco crew we’ve mentioned. Keep in mind, we also have a Disco/Picard mega in our rearview mirror that featured 50% brand new Discovery crew - with no attendant bonuses for Discovery crew outside of specific variants. Variants that Tilly, Reno, Stamets will continue to accrue, but Mrs. Burnham likely will not.

The Disco Revolution appears to be at an end . . . which means cards like these are empty calorie bases that will improve your daily shuttles. To which I say, whoop-de-frickity-doo. If you see her in an Elusive Treasures pack, or in a Behold down the line, swipe left.
