Keyla joined the party shortly before the last Discovery mega and if those had continued, she'd have been sitting pretty. But if you take a look at her event history, you'll notice the precipitous drop in bonus availability once those smothering piles of show bonuses dried up. Between a handful of viable traits and her role in CBS' flagship Trek show, she could and should continue to find work in spurts, just not as a cornerstone piece that we once thought Discovery crew could be.

Having fallen out of voyage consideration for most players, it's become a waiting game to see how many of her traits become those juicy collection/mega combo platters that give older crew big bumps in value.
