The Book gives deference to Cadet eligibility for saving you resources and Trainers in a period of your gameplay where those things can be hard to come by. So for Klingon Dukat to be rated highly with one Cadet arm tied behind his back, you know he's the real deal. A fat CMD top end roll will have him blowing the doors off Sunday Cadet Missions, even if he lacks good supplementary skills, but it's the rest of him that impresses even more.

On ships, Dukat's 400% Instant Damage hammer matches up even against Legendary crew and is worth the price of its Cloak Trigger to activate. His triple stat-boosting make him a premium collection target for players at any stage of play.
