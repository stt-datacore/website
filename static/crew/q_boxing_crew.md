“I’m not Picard.” And then Q never visited DS9 ever again. Costumed and The Continuum collections comprise the bulk of Boxer's value, but aside from events, there's a small window for arena usability provided you can meet his position trigger early or keep your power dry with manual battles until you can. Without a ton more Qs available from the source material, his help in completing The Continuum collection should be safe for a while.
