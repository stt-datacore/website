The latest UberKampaign Legendary comes to us via The Elysian Kingdom episode of Strange New Worlds, which is a fun way to get all the main cast in costume in a time in which there are no Holodecks. 


Lady Audrey Chapel’s release coincides with a Vanity Collection that has been oft-requested and she is among the best crew in it, given her many pros and few cons. Pros include a large MED-led Skill set for both your Voyages and Shuttles, three Stat-boosting Collections (and the aforementioned Elysian Kingdom Vanity), and a sweetheart Ship Ability for Fleet Boss Battles enjoyers. 

WRG seems apt to include lots of Hull Repair crew recently, and Lady Audrey is no different: 25% with a stellar 20s Cycle, but with an Accuracy Boost - you still may want to find an Attack crew like Dereth or First Officer Chekov to be her partner on your Artifact.

Chapel didn’t used to be an Event name but now with Jess Bush portraying a main cast pre-TOS version of the role Majel Barrett originated, those could multiply.
