Ba’ku Worf, now with kung-fu grip! The 2021 Klingon kollection did wonders for the value of a crew who ticks the other long-term value box for super rares - Faction events. As of this writing, Worf has added FIVE new variants to his résumé over the course of a year and his event count sits behind only The Man himself, James T. Kirk. With that juicy collection spot in tow and even some triggerless arena damage for the early game, Worf ends up being about as well-rounded as it gets for 2-skill crew not named Mirror Phlox.
