Kanye's Odo-adjacent brother has done well for himself, aside from that whole failed assassination thing. The low-hanging comparison is the admittedly more fun Sinister Picard. Big voyage power to help offset an awful skill order, collection value, niche gauntlet funsies.

A fairly rich trait lineup may garner the good Colonel a few chances to crash shuttles on the weekend, but it's the strong voyage power in concert with plus antimatter traits that will see him the most action. As a top legendary option for both of his huge stat-boosting collections, he's an obvious and immediate candidate for anyone looking to min/max their endgame potential.
