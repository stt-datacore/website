Holding a spot atop the SCI base rankings, Mulhall has proven more a spreadsheet warrior than roster cornerstone. Only one trait, Exobiology, has borne any fruit from any otherwise lean trait set, leaving her in mop up shuttle duty by only a hair over far more rangy options like Spock or Dax. The Big Book branded "Empty Calories crew™️" would seem to apply here, though the value one gets out of big bases varies largely from player to player.

If you're looking for a supplementary payoff for your investment, it's solely voyage ability which is above average, but in an increasingly crowded skill set. The numbers are there for Pulaski's progenitor, but she'd be a much more comfortable investment if they were attached to repeat value like a main cast name.
