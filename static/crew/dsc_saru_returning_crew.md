Anniversaru is an odd mix of ups and downs, but ultimately debuts to audible applause thanks to a healthy statistical power level. This would be a great crew note to format as a list of pros and cons, but this space best performs as the random musings of a radio psychiatrist on whine. 

The 2021/22 turn flooded the voyage decks with CMD/DIP/SUCK, including two direct skill order superiors to Saru, one of them the recurring mega Lt. Sahil. Saru's traits are also abysmal for anti-matter, two of the three being the ultra competitive Starfleet and Federation tags. As mentioned previously, he does have the raw power, but all of the supporting facets in this area are a let down and make it silly to simply say, 'he's the Xth voyager!' based on his score.

A more firm foundation for usability here may be his bases. He released as "only" the #2 base, but frighteningly closer to North Star Sato than we thought possible for years and tops the list for a couple different "and" shuttle seats. But again, there's a downside - his event history looks to be much more padded out than we should expect moving forward. Discovery megas would need a Miracle Max Pill™ to rise from the dead and only one of his traits has shown willingness to provide weekend value. A great shuttle anchor in the short term and likely to get some non-bonus event work, DIP also has a way of being overstuffed so it's difficult to forecast long term.

Saru's deceptively disappointing trait list dings his collection value as well. He did put his best hoof forward to debut with a pair of traits, but that means less and less now that no fewer than three hundred other legendary crew can boast the same. Unless you're a big believer in Kelpien's time a-comin', beware that you'd be buying high on an area of value that's unlikely to improve.

So while Saru is a lock for immediate (and perhaps consistent) usage, he also lacks all of the fringe and enduring nuances that are the hallmarks of certain other legendary legendaries. This looks to be a better crew to toss a final citation on from their giveaway than it does to build a star at a time after he's joined the portal.
