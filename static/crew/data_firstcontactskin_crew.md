Tempted was ironically the Soong prototype for all the ENG primary Datas that have come after him. In his heyday he was special, but it's been 0.68 seconds since his card was released and Father Time is undefeated.

While nothing to write home about, his Bases should catch adequate Shuttle seating on the weekends thanks to the household name brand of Data and it's likely that we'll see three of his five Traits blossom into Collection value down the road.

Unfortunately his only shot at day to day usage is as a Gauntlet fifth (or new player stalwart. Damn the ENG ranks), but even there his short Trait list caps his chances at elevated Crit and he can't measure up to Red Angel's DIP/ENG pair even with a Crit advantage. Tempted's power level has him in the rank doldrums, but he's not a total dud despite his age.
