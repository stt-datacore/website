Captain Brötchen debuts as a global giveaway to muted applause, statistically speaking. His voyage power won’t garner much enthusiasm nor his worn down skill set, but with a possible star advantage for your roster and handful of non-HFS traits, he may enjoy a limited run on the average roster.

He doesn’t offer many niche attributes either such as arena prowess or some nifty crit gauntlets, but although he lacks vaunted main cast status, Solkar’s trait list has caught WRG’s eye many times before and he should continue snagging a Faction event or two per year.

The tantalizer looking to earn your citation favor is a strong set of collections which debuts at four and may reach its ceiling of six before it’s all said and done. As a stepladder for newer players who may not yet find his offerings redundant, Solkar is an OK option. For late game players, it’s all about dem traits.
