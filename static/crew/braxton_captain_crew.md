Of course his numbers are great, he’s from the future! Braxton’s the #1 overall voyager and #1 voyage CMD (makes sense, it’s not like his crew mutinied and threw him in jail). As of this writing, his lead over voyager #25 is the same gap between #25 and #132. If you’re a stats queen, as the kids say, then Braxton’s the one you want. His voyage work will hog the attention and rightfully so, but he’s not too shabby elsewhere either. In the gauntlet, his lone ranked pair comes in as the #1 ENG/CMD. Be warned, that skill combo is sprinkled with super rare crew and its scoring potential is lower in general, but #1 is #1. He can rotate into your team with two good-not-great single rolls for CMD or ENG gauntlets. His CMD base is a curious thing. There was enough meat on the bone after some fairly robust proficiency numbers for him to pick up a nice big shuttle base, but he has some of the lowest event potential of the top 20 CMD crew, save for perhaps Cartwright and Keiko. If you’re looking to add a CMD base in particular, you may want one of the many Disco or Main Cast characters, but as just another attribute for a sterling crew it’s a nice addition and should provide handy support for daily shuttles.
