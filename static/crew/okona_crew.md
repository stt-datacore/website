Much like his dreamboat on-screen character, The Outrageous Okona gives us just what we want - gauntlet and voyage work from a one-off name. There may be a bit of event shuttle work in the cards thanks to his rogueish trait set, but modest bases instead allow room for more frequent dice rolling. He leverages two middle-strength rolls into the #2 DIP/ENG pair, affording you the chance to smack The Caretaker around even though Red Angel has pipped Okona for #1 on that pair.

Some turn of the decade crew have helped bolster the DIP/ENG voyage ranks, but it's still a pair on the thinner side, giving Okona above average returns there and especially in the DIP/ENG/SEC triplet. Jury Rigger is easier to complete than it used to be, but it may yet be expanded like some others have been recently. The Thad-of-all-trades is fine behold value, even if he lacks name recognition.
