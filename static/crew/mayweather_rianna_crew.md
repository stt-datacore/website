Travis' mom has a scintillating skill set, but don't be suckered in. There's no power behind the skills and, in fact, little to no daily use whatsoever. This is a pure collection card who, should she hit on a few trait megas, will likely not find enough shuttle seats to contribute due to a general lack of MED and ENG seats during events.
