Tilly has done a lot of soul-searching in her time aboard Discovery. From plucky young Ensign lacking confidence to jaded Lieutenant with enough experiences under her belt to impress any hardened Starfleet officer, perhaps her greatest challenge came when it was time to eat Rigelian rutabaga, er, um to lead an away mission of Cadets onto an ice-strewn moon. After a rocky start she came into herself and found a passion for leading and guiding the next generation of Starfleet Officers.

Fitting, then, that she debut with high marks in CMD Base and Voyages! Though her Event count is buoyed by previous Mega Traits there is still a lot of promise there, and that’s before we consider the upcoming Disco Mega (who had that on their Bingo card?)! These Traits also bring with them solid Voyage seating options and 3 current Stat-Boosting Collections, with a Disco collection on its way, meaning even elderly players will want to get their hands on her ÜberKampaign track. Coming online as fast as Jett Reno and her identical +10000 Crit Boost means there could be some Arena potential here as well for those that like to find new combinations outside of the going meta.
