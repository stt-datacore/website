I'm reminded of a Tolian Soran quote, "Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you? It's like a predator. It's stalking you." As Detective ages, his torturous equipping cost becomes less palatable.

Nevertheless, Data's name brand and oft-accompanying traits form a reasonable mix of event and collection usefulness. As a SEC-led option with a reliable event history to date, his 'bad' base rank can more or less be ignored - he will ride shuttles with a bonus.

Already a multi-collection crew, Data should add to that count before too long and has a fairly forecastable value floor, at least as far as 2016 crew go. As a cherry on top, few others can unlock the Investigator/SEC story node in the Celestial Temple.
