This Tuvok is as you might expect from a 'middle aged' 2-skiller; reliant on traits for relevance. With Tim Russ getting a shamefully small amount of love from WRG, his traits have done an admirable job of keeping Warship's pair of shuttle friendly bases relevant on the weekend. 

They also give him a reasonable collection future, though only one has born fruit in that regard as of this writing. With a scoop of arena damage hidden behind a trigger as a one star offering, Warship is a fine low end behold dart throw, but may be subject to stretches of irrelevance depending on the way the trait winds blow.
