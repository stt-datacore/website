Clearly bowing to pressure from Timelines Talks, noted #1 premium, exclusive stream for all things Star Trek: Timelines, Ryn the Andorian is the kind of card that makes players sigh in envy and wallets scream in dread. Starting from the top, the art - instantly memeable, but also unique among the recent spate of artwork for definitely not being a promotional picture trace, giving it a flavour that the beautiful but sterile art a lot of crew get these days are sorely missing. Pose him next to a displeased Killy or another pointing crew for instant hilarity. Worth diving into a six pack for just on that basis alone, really, but WRG made sure to stack the deck in favour of Ryn on almost every field.

The trait list is tier 1 all on its own, brimming with collections ranging from the massive to the elusive, and while Prisoner is more of an outside chance than a hard lock, Hero has been requested for quite some time now, so he's not even tapped out yet. Reams of HFS crew are looking at this guy's AM coverage with envy - while power voyagers like Returning Saru or Mark Jameson are scrabbling over the same few seats, Ryn can stroll right in and sit himself down wherever he wants almost without competition. Even someone who duped ScapegO'Brien will still use Ryn thanks to his equivalent power, hefty ENG base and differing skill order.

While Ryn is unlikely to stack up as many variants as fan favourites Garak or Dukat, his event prospects are still rosy - even playing down the past-its-sell-by date Discovery hidden tag, he's stumbled into four trait megas and will likely stumble into even more. Even without bonus, he can hold down shuttles for Factions with anaemic ENG coverage, and on rosters that are strapped for space, the relatively small difference in base between him and Ru'afo might find you freezing the stretchy one in favour of someone you can use in, you know. Other actual areas of the game. In the end, the Big Book can't tell you how to spend your Dil, and if you've been burned before, we can't blame you from saying no to a potentially hefty price tag. But if you're feeling lucky, there are few crew worth chancing it on quite like Ryn - and hey, if you just wait a year or so, he'll still be a banger voyager and incredibly easy to retrieve! Win-win! Or would that be Ryn-Ryn . . ?
