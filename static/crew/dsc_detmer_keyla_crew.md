A near-copy of Vosk, Detmer trades a bit of his Voyage power for a stronger CMD base and the all-important Disco trait, which means she walks in the door with a healthy event count and the #1 CMD and #4 ENG base for Disco purples. Throw in a few potentially eventable traits, and a stat-boosting collection that she puts on the precipice of no longer needing any Legendaries to complete, and you've got a recipe for a crew just about every roster can find a use for.
