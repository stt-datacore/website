Born as an impressive daily use option, Quark is making the graceful transition to collection era target. Seven non-HFS traits, all with the potential to be "something" in the future, gives him plenty of whacks at the collection and event pi√±ata. With fringe-playable voyage ability in the right situation and variant events as a cushion, Tourist Quark turns a build cost light on Ferengi faction items into a bargain payoff that would make any Ferengi blush.
