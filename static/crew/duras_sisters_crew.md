“Human females are so repulsive!” Uh...Yeah. The Golden Girls here aren't winning any beauty pageants for their stats either.

Long respected for their arena attack boost with a relatively low cost to entry, there are simply too many competitive options, including those available through crew retrieval, to make a ten second trigger worth it. As an “upgrade” option for otherwise useless blue Duras crew after you’ve finished their first copies, everyone should try to make this fusion crew at your leisure for their collection and immortalization notches.
