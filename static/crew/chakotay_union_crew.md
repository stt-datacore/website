If this Union man wasn't costumed, you wouldn't look twice. Chakotay offers an edge case arena attack boost and some sporadic event bonuses, but between stat ranks that may well have been printed years ago and a skill set you have a hundred of, his six-pack introduction feels more like marketing data point collecting than a crew you should seek to acquire.
