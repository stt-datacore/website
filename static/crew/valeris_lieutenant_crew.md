Reprehensible bases make the event count meaningless in this case, but four event features - three of which were a Galaxy (10x bonus) - probably will make a splash for most users. Valerisâ€™ main daily contribution comes in the gauntlet where her strong overall proficiency meets a pair of 45% crit gauntlets - new players should be able to utilize her well early on.

Her arena ability is worth a look as a fast activating accuracy boost, though it lacks the crit punch of Ardra or her many lesser disciples. With a middling collection profile in tow, Valeris remains pretty well rounded and certainly a far better performing super rare than almost any other from 2016.
