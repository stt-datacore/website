There's a lot to like about ol’ Bare and it starts with his art which exudes strong Fonzie energy. While his outward appearance may be misleading (how did trained Starfleet officers fall for it twice?!?), he's among the best mega recurring crew WRG ever released and still provides value years later.

His rare skill set will buoy his voyage efficacy above surface level ranks and is further aided by anti-matter opportunities thanks to an eclectic trait set. With benefits from said set extending to collections, events, and even some 45% gauntlets, Barry remains a fine option to star up even for newer players and is likely to be putting in work for years more while vanilla skill set mega cards are crowded out of service.
