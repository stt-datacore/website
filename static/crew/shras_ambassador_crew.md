Owner of a huge DIP base, but with few events in which to multiply it. Despite those poor event chances and the most common skill set, he’s still useful for newer players with shuttle-worthy DIP and +1 Diplomat for long term benefit. His +9 arena attack boost can meet or exceed what the more popular Rura Penthe Reed and Duras Sisters offer.
