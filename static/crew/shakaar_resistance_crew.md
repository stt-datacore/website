Lucky to escape the drawing board with the Veteran trait, Shakaar’s ~800 CMD base is reliant on stray trait (mega) events, such as the mid 2019 Bajoran weekend. Even his lone tangible benefit, the Veteran trait, qualifies him for one of the easier collections to complete which includes four previous mega event crew.
