Years of wailing and gnashing of teeth over Scotty's dreary in-game representation paid off as (formerly) DB backed up the Dump Truck of Power to this super serious Tribble variant.

Not much of a gauntlet asset (any reasonable metric is solely the result of the gaping ENG chasm behind The Caretaker), Scotty gleans his voyage power primarily off the back of his bases, including ENG power that will earn plenty of shuttle work. If he should ever pick up his first variant Faction event, smashing shuttles should be no tribble at all.

Scotty's utility elsewhere is held together by Spit and Bailing Wire, but considering his effectiveness for daily work, he'll make you forget all about other empty calorie ENG bases. Now, say it with me. "I didn't mean to say that Ru'afo should be hauling garbage....I meant to say that he should be hauled away AS GARBAGE!"
