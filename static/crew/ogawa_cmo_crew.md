Whilst MED skills are quite common in the lower rankings of crew cards they become much more sparse later on. Which is why you'll probably find that Ogawa will linger in your manifest longer than she probably should. A #5 MED base will only get you so far however but she fills out the Physician collection nicely with a decent ship ability. Just don't expect her to be much use on voyages if you have Commando Crusher or Raquetball Bashir in your ranks.
