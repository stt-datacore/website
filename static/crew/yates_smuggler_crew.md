Yates had her moment in Timelines history when she was the only out of portal super rare Jury Rigger to help complete that tricky collection, but how she's merely a short string of traits. Freeze and forget like most low end purples - maybe thaw her once a year if her bonus lines up with a situation where you'll be sending waves of requisition shuttles.
