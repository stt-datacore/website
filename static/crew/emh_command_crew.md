One of the few skill sets (MED/CMD) capable of redeeming poor voyage numbers. Laps his competition for the variant-best CMD base, but not in a high enough amount to be a real difference maker and recent Hologram mega inflated a bonus count which includes only five variant events. Best suited to early-mid game voyage work.
