Tilly nabs a place in the Timelines history books as the second crew (first super rare) to debut through campaigns. That's a fortuitous landing spot for her, because she lacks all the essential long term attributes, while offering short term work through voyages and a top ten base.

The Tilly family's fatal flaw rears its head again - her lack of traits. Lucky to escape the drawing board with Explorer, that will probably be her only avenue for collections or event bonuses, the latter of which is sorely needed for a character who has averages less than an event per year outside of Discovery megas.
