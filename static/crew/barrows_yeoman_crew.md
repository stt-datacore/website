As a last-minute replacement for Grace Lee Whitney’s Janice Rand on the “Shore Leave” episode of TOS, Tonia Barrows has now spawned two crew cards, including older big sister Princess Barrows of the Legendary Rarity. While the Princess has some long-term Collection value, little sister Yeoman has little or no enduring game value due to a thin Trait list.

It’s true for a early game player or Nightmare Mode™ enjoyer she may staff Shuttles and Voyages with her decent debut Stats, but other than that, mid to late-game players will Immortalize and Freeze this crew and hope for her Romantic Trait to bear fruit someday.
