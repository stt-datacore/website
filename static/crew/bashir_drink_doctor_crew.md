Luck was a lady to Big Julie who picked up two collections posthaste following his debut. He didn’t stop there, of course, and enjoyed time near the peak of Super Rare collection value.

By way of one of the most unintentionally hilarious ship ability names out there, Jules is also competent in the realms of arena and skirmish. His +9 attack boost is as good as it gets for triggerless super rare options and it comes online fast enough and lasts long enough to sit among the premier options at his rarity.

Having gotten this far without mentioning voyages or events is noteworthy, but Bashir brings it there too. Competent voyage metrics paired with a skill order that is nearly unique across rarities makes him a fine option there into the mid-game and he might be your only realistic SCI option among Bashir variants if you're not into stacking stars on the milquetoast Eaton. An extraordinarily well-rounded crew on release means that he’s weathered power creep fairly well and is still worth a stab in any behold.
