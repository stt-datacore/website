M*A*S*H*ed together from bits of old Stranded Odo, the good Father has some reasonable event work to his name, including a few big bonus features. His daily work is pretty fictitious at this point, though a long list of non-bloated traits makes Chaplain an extremely interesting proposition in the midst of WRG's collection push.

The pie in the sky, moon shot, best case scenario outcome for this card could feasibly be seven collections. That said, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush - opt for crew who can help you now or have real collections, not just the ones we hope for.
