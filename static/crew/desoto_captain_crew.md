If you’re just here for the numbers, grab a chair in the back - we’ll get there in a minute. Robbie kicks off the ””””Player’s choice”””” mega with unsubstantiated scientific acumen and the voyage prowess of a man who does more than “haul his butt back and forth between starbases”. He’s frankly a Frankenstein of a crew, but at least he’s got the numbers and, hey, what else matters?

A single digit voyage rank debut automatically guarantees crew a 3+ year voyage profile, even if their skill set is on the weaker side, as DeSoto’s is. Throw in a few anti-matter seats and you’re looking at instant relevance for Mr. Irrelevant. 

Top ten in base too, DeSoto’s probably not the first name you grab for non-bonus weekend work, but he might snag a mega here or there via his thin trait pool. Ardra-esque in the arena, there are surely angles for DeSoto to contribute on your roster, even if you have to Google the sixty second scene he comes from.
