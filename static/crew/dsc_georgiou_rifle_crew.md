Pretty favorable crew makeup for the CMD/DIP/SEC skill set, or one with a thin trait set. Georgiou has probably outlived her voyage usefulness in most situations thanks to a particularly poor skill set, but with double collections and a monstrous event clip (and event future), she'll do most of her heavy lifting post-cryo.
