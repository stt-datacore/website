Quau is the latest Mega Event Recurring Legendary with John de Lancie’s likeness, and unfortunately since his debut in 2021 the Power Creep has accelerated to the point where this crew is probably buried somewhere in the sand on the Voyager Holodeck.

CMD/DIP/SEC outside of the top ranks is a dime a dozen, and Luau Q is well outside those top ranks by now. Q finds Events like rats find cheese, as JDL is still the voice of Timelines, so he’s a strong investment from that perspective, and if you can find copies of this crew via Legendary Behold enough to Immortalize him, you shall be rewarded with three Collections (including the Q Continuum which requires a supermajority of the eligible crew to complete it) and you may find future spoils in coming months with more.
