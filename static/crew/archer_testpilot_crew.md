A different flavour of Archer from a different time. A time of daring, a time of reaching beyond the limits. An Archer that will fly right into the Danger Zone. Which is my way of saying that this Archer is a little different, sporting a unique, and rather hefty, top 10 SCI base, and the overall best ENG of any of the Archers, including the 5* variants. +1 Inspiring is always nice to snag for cards that otherwise might be lacking in long term benefits - Archer's events have been picking up as of late, but he still has some catching up to do - and his skillset, while not exactly rare, is still handy to have in abundance if you want your voyages to go further, faster, more. A lack of Gauntlet play or particularly eventable traits, and a pretty poor ship ability, hold him back from being truly great, but especially on younger rosters, he's going to serve you extremely well. Even more seasoned crew quarters can find a place for him on voyages or daily shuttles.
