Reminiscent of North Star Archer (good voyage and SEC base numbers), but without long term perks. When he's bumped from your active roster, his thawpertunities rely solely on four traits. If you can star him up early, enjoy his strong daily performance. If your roster is more established, heâ€™s a trait mega dice roll.
