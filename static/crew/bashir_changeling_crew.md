One of the best Voyage Skill sets in the game marred by that tiny little caveat of having about a thousand crew ahead of him in raw power. This isn't 2017 anymore so don't go all soft lens on his dollop of ENG/MED; it's not hard to find better options, even if they only match a part of his Skill set.

Long term, he's at least serviceable with a mouthwatering smörgåsbord of Traits and variant Events to elevate poor Bases enough to give him plenty of whacks at the requisition Shuttle piñata. A late Collection bloomer, Bashir has enough viable Traits to see him potentially flare up in value down the line, much like his shuttlecraft.
