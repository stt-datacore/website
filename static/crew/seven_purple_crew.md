No, Honey, I was listening. But I can't this weekend, my mother is stopping by to visit us. Why are you looking at me like that? Folks, be glad that you're not the one she's glaring at. The newest model in fusion cuisine, Fury Seven combines with a pricier legendary crew to form a unique and powerful five star Seven. As a standalone super rare, this crew marks the end of the Borg collection requiring a legendary crew to complete and pitches in competent shuttle SCI for events which come at a reasonable clip. But you'll likely get more use out of her final form provided you can meet the asking price.
