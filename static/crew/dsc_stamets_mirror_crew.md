Just like his brother Navigator Stamets, Mirror debuted with a #1 Disco base and above average voyage numbers. What pushes him into elite territory is added event potential via traits (#1 Mirror SCI) and a skill set which has received several recent additions, but is still rare enough to guarantee Mirror Stamets a spot on your voyages. Think of him as da Vinci junior with less daily power, but explosive event potential.
