Formerly the best daily use voyage exclusive, Jannar typically takes too long to fuse these days to make much of an impact. There's some niche arena use in the way of instant damage, but you're really just looking to stack stars for his collection value down the line. 

A two-parter reward, it's not advisable for Jannar to be one of your purple citation targets, but if it's keeping you up at night, he's at least a crew who should never hit the portal.
