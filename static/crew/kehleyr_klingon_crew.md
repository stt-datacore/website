The folks over at the 'Plakson's Pals' fan club (not to be confused with Combs' Chums) are flipping cartwheels over the first of what they hope are four variants from the smolderingly steamy season two Klingon romance episode. But is the crew actually good for non-fanatics? Well...

K'Ehleyr had fine stats for an affection pick on release, but no longer. Now best thought of as a one star gauntlet grab for new rosters or trait dart throw for bored veterans, this card does not exceed the sum of its parts. If only CMD/DIP/SEC Klingons were harder to find.
