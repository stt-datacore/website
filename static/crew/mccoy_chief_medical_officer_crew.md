Strange that one of the most iconic characters in Star Trek known for his medical prowess would be given one of the worst MED cards in the game. He has the lowest primary medical score and is the third worst MED overall. His ship ability, whilst giving +3 accuracy, also demands -2 attack. You will already have a better medical card by now and probably the only reason to hold onto him is the Physician collection.
