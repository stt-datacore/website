Not a standout by conventional metrics, Worf at least always has events to fall back on. Getting more weekend chances at the bat than one might think by glancing at his trait list, there’s faction action aplenty here and he’s even managed to reach his forecasted collection ceiling before most other cards. This isn’t a terribly multi-faceted option for usage day to day, but you know exactly what you’ll be getting if you select him in a behold.
