Like our good buddy Vargas, 6-pack Wyatt checks all the wrong boxes for crew. Not main cast, poor traits, two skills... His notable avenue for value, arena instant damage, has become little more than an eyebrow raiser as Wyatt joins over a dozen other crew who fill the same role at eight seconds or better; many without Wyatt's trigger restriction.

This card is definitely punching above his weight class with a hefty command base and if you can slingshot yourself around the sun back to 2018's Pilot mega to plug him into a shuttle for a few days, by all means. Otherwise, leave this one to the collectors and head to the forums to complain about the degradation of the prestige of legendary crew.
