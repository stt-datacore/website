Stranded Quark is carrying in his backpack all the Legendary Citations that players have dolloped on him since 2019, but he’ll no longer be able to carry your Voyage roster due to his advancing age. Despite a brilliant Skill set and order, he’s been squeezed out of your top 12 list, but it’s not all bad news for this Ferengi.

A sizable DIP Base gives him the ability to pitch in whenever his name is called on the weekend, and variant Events plus plenty of fun Trait bonuses makes him a solid choice to Fuse via Crew Retrieval. A trio of Collections and a ceiling of six makes him a strong long-term investment.
