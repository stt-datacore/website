Gabe's voyage ability is waning hard due to an extremely bloated skill set, but long term players will be happy to acquire double collections including the enormous Costume Party and the only DIP primary option at the super rare or legendary level for Sisko events. Daily work would be considered optimistic past the early game, but he's worth a pickup for any roster.
