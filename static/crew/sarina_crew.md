Sarina was a magnificent voyager on debut - one who could play with the big boy legendaries. She can still make runs for newer rosters today, but almost all her other attributes are long past their expiration date.

A thin trait set tanks her desirability for events and collections while a potentially gauntlet-friendly skill set lacks the proficiency power to make much headway. If you can collect all four stars early on in your Timelines journey, feel free to do so to help supplement your voyages. If not, take your time adding stars to a crew with disappointing long term usability.
