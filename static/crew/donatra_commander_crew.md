Besides being the best part of Nemesis, Donatra is a refreshingly valuable Romulan card that rises above bad bases and common skills thanks to competitive gauntlet pairs (top five super rare proficiency total) and a set of stat-boosting collections. It's anyone's guess when she might draw some cryostasis reprieve for events, but she already has something to offer rosters young and old.
