A very standard CMD card with common pairings. Chances are if you are gunning to get this guy to level 100 then you will have some better crew with these statistics. However he does have the #16 CMD base stat and his voyage potential is not bad, it’s just very standard. I would only recommend him if he is your only blue card available, otherwise spend the chrons elsewhere.
