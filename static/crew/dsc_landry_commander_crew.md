A total non-entity to veteran players, Landry is a crew who will only find work for fresh rosters. A big SEC proficiency headlines her offerings, but with awful supplementary rolls she won’t make many gauntlets past the mid-game, even at 45% crit.

Her other notable attribute is a quick-activating attack boost on ships. It doesn’t last for long and so may not play well with auto battles, but if you manage to snag multiple copies at once and fuse her up, that can be a consideration.
