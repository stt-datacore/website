It’s always important to view a former Mega Recurring Legendary through the lens of your current roster, not what the other players in your Fleet are saying. That being said, 2024 Picard should still be Voyaging for a lot of players into the actual year 2024 in Star Trek: Timelines, given his excellent debut power which has helped him stave off Power Creep™.

A strong Skill set highlighted by a generous SCI Base and Tertiary SEC helps him to avoid the CMD/DIP/SUCK trap, and a solid sextet of Antimatter Traits give him plenty of seating opportunities. Picard Events are pretty clockwork and his ancillary Traits will pitch in when his name isn’t called as a variant. 

Four Collections may be about all he gets until WRG scrapes the bottom of the barrel, but that’s a decent amount for this Picard.
