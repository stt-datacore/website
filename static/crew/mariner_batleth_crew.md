Don't let the rusty bat'leth fool you, this Mariner is as sharp as can be. Debuting in a Lower Decks themed event that boasted card coherency quite unlike WRG's usual offerings, you'd be hard pressed to find a character that does everything you want in a crew quite so quickly as Mariner. Even if all you snag is one star from community rewards, you'll still be pulling down instant ship damage and Gauntlet capability usually reserved for far more precious legendary crew - they simply don't print Super Rare Gauntlet crew very often, and a combination of relatively common crit traits and a MED tertiary mean she can kick it with crew that were far more expensive to obtain.

If you went the extra mile and grabbed her other stars from ranked rewards, you'll find yourself with a top flight voyager, both in terms of power and skill set, and while she may not have the Spock or Sisko collection pedigree, this is the kind of crew that pushes you out of the no-man's-land in between collection milestones that you come to appreciate as you become an elderly player. If this is a portent of Lower Decks crew to come, then let the good times roll and the bloodwine flow.
