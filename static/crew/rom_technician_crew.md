Don’t underestimate this card, he has the highest 2* ENG base and fills out two extra collections. His Jury Rigger trait will unlock a fair few nodes and his ship ability adds some hull repair to your ship battling ensemble. Poor DIP scores limit his voyaging ability however but he will get a fair few of Tuesday’s cadet missions unlocked for you.
