Another incarnation of the "daily use" crew. Following a 2019 ENG avalanche, Presage is more of a strong voyager with an interesting collection set and a base which will make multi-week splashes as her traits allow. As a crew in a vacuum, she's good-not-great as a package, but is one of the more daily-useful vanity crew out there whose SCI/ENG voyage work is comparable to a Leonardo or Honey Bare.
