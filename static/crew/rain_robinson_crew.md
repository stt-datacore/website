It's a shame that the scales are tipped in favor of Rain's dual 1k bases which, to date, have barely tasted the event spotlight. If the numbers were shifted a bit, they could push her top ten SCI/ENG gauntlet pair past even the freakasaurus Caretaker. Her duo 45% gauntlets and middling overall proficiency present some one-star opportunity for fresh rosters.

Alas, her voyage run has all but winded down and leaves a wishful trait list behind. Starting off with the massive Resourceful collection was a pleasant surprise and gives the rest of Rain's fairly large trait pools the potential for great growth in that area, but are at the mercy of WRG's dart board. As we all are. Help. We must escape. I want to live again.
