You can almost hear some cartoonish villain taunting Mirror T'Pol with labels of "old" and "weak" and it's regrettably true. She's buried behind a couple different walls for her top two gauntlet pairs and her voyage numbers nearly have her cozying up to some 2-skill crew. While more useful for new players, she'll find herself edged out for daily use on many rosters.

Where she comes into relevance, however, are events and collections. She's had countless megas including a mind-blowing four out of a possible six during 2020, thanks mostly to a fat stack of traits that hold untold potential for future weekend bonuses and stat-boosting collections. If your behold doesn't include any daily use options, T'Pol is as worth the risk as any other trait treasure chest.
