Gauntlet and Collections generally go hand in hand - that's the magic of Traits. In this case, Lyndsay is capped at 25% crit, but does own a fair number of elevated Crit Gauntlets to highlight overall Proficiencies that are worth using, at least among Super Rares. Butting heads with The Red Angel is rarely a wise idea and Jhet'leya only just matches her DIP/ENG pair with a Crit advantage, but as a stopgap or early game option, she'll do well.

Gauntlet is her only shot at daily use with understandably 2016 bases taking Shuttles and Voyages out of the equation, but as a multi-Collection piece on day one with some room to improve in that area, Jhet'leya has a little something for rosters young and old.
