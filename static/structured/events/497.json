Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using any version of Pallra, Damar, Solbor, Cardassians, or Bajorans will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the Cardassian Keldon Class, the U.S.S. Raging Queen, the Val Jean, or ships with the Battlecruiser trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards.
