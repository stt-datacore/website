For a Faction as widely beloved as the the Dominion and the war they waged against the Alpha Quadrant during the majority of DS9's runtime, they have a remarkably poor track record when it comes to representation in Timelines, and strangely enough, Ixtana'Rax both bucks and reinforces this trend. On the one hand, he's currently the highest rated Dominion card in the entire game, thanks to a weighty SEC base, a decent smattering of traits, and an ENG kicker that means he'll function similarly to Carpenter Street Archer or Wrathful Kirk on voyages.

On the other hand, his collections profile is, at least at time of writing, about as DOA as the Alpha Quadrant Jem'Hadar storyline was on DS9 (it says a lot when your serious combat storyline wrinkle is introduced in a comedy episode about a shrunken runabout and then promptly dropped), he's still fundamentally a SEC/CMD card without the requisite voyage power to age gracefully, and his event chances are . . . poorly defined, to say the least. Ultimately, this is a card that will be made or unmade by whether those traits bear fruit. If you see Maverick or Dominion collections, then you'll be glad you bet on this stalwart warrior. If he goes a year and Timicin is picking up more collections than he is, you'll have committed a tactical error so grave he himself would send you back to basic. Oh, the perils of command . . .
