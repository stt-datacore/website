Two guns J-dog here is a fair all rounder with a powerful CMD stat, enough to hit a critical node or two in the cadet challenges. Early game voyages will give him plenty of use. Sadly no collection bonuses for him and he is greatly let down by his ship ability. Consider moving him on once youâ€™ve gotten better CMD crew and hit those few cadet nodes.
