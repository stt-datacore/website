The venerable creator of the M-5 computer and namesake for the Daystrom Institute and award has long had an equally deferential following among players, but his time in the sun is pretty much over. A top five SCI roll and SCI/ENG pair _was _fantastic, but hasn't been nearly as powerful since the propagation gauntlet exclusives Caretaker and Armus. His (lack of) bases and event work have no business stealing more stars from other crew, even if there are two stat-boosting collections at the end of the rainbow. He still outperforms this ranking with his first star, but investing any more than that is bordering on foolhardy.
