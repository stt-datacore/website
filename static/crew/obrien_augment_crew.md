Maybe the most well-rounded 2-skill Legendary in the game could remain that way for a while as WRG has dialed back those types of releases, presumably for sales reasons.

His SEC/ENG Proficiency pair is number one in the Gauntlet and he has two usable Bases for Event work. A rich and intriguing Trait list augments both as Auggie's Event history is more machine than man and a whopping five 45% Gauntlet sets give him a legitimate claim for Gauntlet consideration. His single SEC roll can pick up plenty of wins with that amount of Crit while some 2-for-1 situations against Caretaker or Gary Seven will be a cakewalk.

The sizable cherry on top is his Collection value, again powered by that great lineup of Traits. With a spot in the Originals collection all sewn up, he has a massive value ceiling in this area and is more than worth the Behold capital if your other options don't include daily use mainstays. Look for Auggie to catch up to three additional Collections to go with his current two non-Vanity inclusions.
