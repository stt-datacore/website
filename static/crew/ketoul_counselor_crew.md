Incorrect application of the word “Counselor” aside (Neera is not a Counselor like Deanna Troi is a Counselor, but she is an Attorney, who are often referred to as “counselors”), we get our first Illyrian to go along with the latest “courtroom drama” episode of Star Trek. Neera Ketoul has neither the Voyage power nor a plus Skill set to excite us in that realm, but her Trait list is interesting enough to look further. Eclectic Traits like the aforementioned Counselor and Interrogator sidle up alongside current Collection Traits like Resourceful and Communicator to give her a solid ceiling of six once WRG chugs their way through the monthly Collection drop (Content Train™ intensifies) and gets to them. Neera has enough juice in her common Primary and Secondary Bases to pitch in on the weekends when she finds a Trait-based bonus, and is a fine Crew Retrieval candidate once she hits the Time Portal for her Collection possibilities.
