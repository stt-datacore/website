His daily numbers aren't terrible, but when a crew debuts with middling stats, you know they won't age well. There's nothing remarkable about April aside from a massive arena attack ability, which, in combination with an accuracy handicap and not coming online until ten seconds, many players will eschew in favor of faster damage crew. With how little love The Animated Series receives, you may not ever notice April's presence on your roster.
