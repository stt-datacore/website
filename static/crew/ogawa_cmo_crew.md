Alyssa and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Card. Just a complete nothing burger, you can feel free to point to her lone stat-boosting collection or her one day per week cadet eligibility, but neither are really worth the chronitons and trainers that could be better spent on more versatile options that cover both of her slim offerings. We recommend airlocking Ogawa early on for space and only swinging back around to immortalize her when youâ€™re on the precipice of a Physician collection milestone.
