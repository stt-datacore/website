You weren't the only one who had to look up this crew on Memory Alpha, so let's start out with an easy crew comparison to the equally impure Klingon Neelix. They have matching SEC scores and rely on a smattering of Traits for weekend work, but Laneth has some nice untapped ones and a few already in Collections.

Speaking of, her trio of Collections is delightful value for someone you may have never heard of. Laneth won’t sniff daily work in the vast majority of situations, but has a realistic shot to hit her value ceiling and is worth thawing a few times per year.
