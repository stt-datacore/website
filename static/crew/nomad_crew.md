Nomad coordinate! Oops, wrong episode. Well, equally iconic to the Original Series faithful is the suppository-looking Nomad. This probe's über sophisticated tech doesn't quite translate in game, leaving him on the outside looking in for daily use. 

An interesting cocktail of traits should lengthen Nomad's voyage lifespan just a hair and, if you cross your fingers hard enough, offer up some event chances down the line. With WRG's collection push in full bloom and a few collections in hand already, Nomad is in line to serve man for at least a while longer.
