No more trouble in my body or my mind. Gonna live like a king on whatever I find. Eat all the fruit and throw away the rind.'

Sadly, Adam is the rind on the watermelon of life. A splash of MED/CMD and a third skill might have you running to check his voyage numbers, but I'll save you the trip - he is for most purposes merely a 2-skill crew. And while DIP seats are plentiful, this former top three base crew hasn't gone a month without losing ground.

Now before you call me a Herbert, Adam's not totally a lost cause. One of his less likely traits, Resourceful, already hit on a massive collection and Musician or Spiritual could easily do the same along with possibly providing (more) events down the line. Adam should sit way down on the list of Resourceful crew you might consider citing for the collection, but there is a little room for growth in The Garden of Eden.
