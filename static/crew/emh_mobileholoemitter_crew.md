The former MED base leader has officially fallen out of the top ten. The king is dead, long live the king. On voyages, the numbers speak for themselves in a way that even a handy skill order has trouble saving. But a crew with sinking effectiveness in all corners, was thrown a lifeline in the form of Fusion-palooza! As a standalone card he still has event value, but as a catalyst to create the ultra useful Indulgent Seven, he has new life. Despite Father Time bearing down on him, Mobile Doc is still a handy card to come across at the behold screen.
