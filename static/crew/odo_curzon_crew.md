There was a time when you could call KurzOdo the best crew in the game. His DIP base was monstrous and his event work unchallenged. Nowadays, the game welcomes a big DIP seemingly every other week while crew you've never heard of blow past his impressive event count due to the plethora of trait and TV-fueled mega events. So where does that leave Zhian'tara Odo?

Well, his utility is low, but the dude's event value abides. Z'Odo qualifies for Odo AND Dax events which, combined, have never failed to tally at least three events in a calendar year. Working in concert with an interesting trait set and shuttle-oriented skill set, Zhian'tara's weekend situation is a special offering that you'll want to acquire if possible while you wait patiently for the trait tree to bear collection fruit.
