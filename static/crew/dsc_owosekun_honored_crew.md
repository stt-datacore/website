Flying under the radar for her lack of an on-screen presence, OwO (what's this?) still brings the goods with a few more years of voyage ability and multiple collections which should reach (and stop at) three. The end of the Discovery deluge predictably torpedoed her weekend usability, but worthwhile bases will provide spot use on shuttles and shine with a rare bonus.
