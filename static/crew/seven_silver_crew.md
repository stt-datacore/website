We usually try to be kind to the mishmash of event-only names in the bottom few tiers, but this Seven variant is notably more dire than most. Averaging only a single faction event per year and owning an ENG primary that can struggle for seating are two ingredients in her recipe for disaster. With so few traits with which to garnish her collection or event viability, this is one card that could have used more time in the oven.
