Formerly an all-star at the super rare level, the game has since seen plenty of the base/voyage/event triad types, pushing top shelf crew to have something extra on their résumé to stand out. This Burnham does not.

Still a vaunted event name in Timelines, Burnham offers almost nothing else of value and has been particularly hampered by a pathetic trait lineup that’s missing Vulcan. She may snag a collection or two in the future, but this is a cryo vault piece just waiting for the next faction bonus in order to pitch in.
