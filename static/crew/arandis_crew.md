Who would have thought that a former Miss America would be a part of your geeky card collection...strange days. Arandis' Traits didn't trigger much of a reaction on release, but as we're now adrift in the eye of WRG's Collection hurricane, her handful of viable offerings look that much more attractive.

Multi-Collection value is an easy way to tempt veteran players and her Shuttle metrics are still good enough to merit the thaw if her Traits, large though they are, were to catch bonuses in the future. There's certainly a limit to Arandis' utility, but the value is there in specific areas.
