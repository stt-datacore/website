As old greets new and the past meets the present, Captain Burnham is proud to help formally reopen Starfleet Academy for the first time since the Burn. It’s a powerful moment for the Federation and hopes to inspire all (the fictional cadets and us the viewer) for the season to come. Plus there’s Space Dock porn!

Book warned her not to punch Rillak for hijacking the occasion to politick, and she complied, so that probably explains the complete lack of Gauntlet utility. That’s okay though, because what definitely inspires us is the rest of her stats!. She may be “merely” a Super Rare, but what a mighty one she is! An absolute All-Star for Voyages and Shuttles, Academy Speech Burnham will anchor many a young lineup still searching for good Legendary Crew (and the cites to finish them off) thanks to her availability in a Hybrid Event that lets you get all 4 copies with relative ease (if you’re going to spend Chronitons on an Event, folks, this is THE Purple Crew to target!). A trusty Event name, Burnham will also find use down the line even as you replace her Voyage and Shuttle Base. Presumably tapped out on Collections at 4 (unless WRG runs out of ideas and somehow Fed, Human, or Starfleet ever hit), she’s a helpful piece in a few large Stat-Boosting ones that will be a welcome addition to any roster.
