The DIP/CMD gauntleteers (where the Kai ranks 6th) face stiffer competition than any other pair which is a blessing and a curse - competition is fierce, but there's no dominant "wall" crew that can't be caught napping. Her only chance at contributing beyond that very narrow window would seem to be something along the lines of a Bajoran event.
