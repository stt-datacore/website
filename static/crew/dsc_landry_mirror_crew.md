This Landry is on a bit of a journey that mirrors (sorry) the development of Timelines. A few years ago she was a strong event option with plenty of Discovery and Mirror in her future. Then shortly after those ceaseless megas...ceased, she was kind of a dud with just one collection.

As of this writing, WRG is hawking traits like they're Tamagotchis and it's 1999. Which means that her future is somewhere between nearly useless and a quad-collection piece with occasional mega work. There's surely a ceiling on her value, but the fact that she may not have hit it yet can be worth a shot in the dark in an otherwise stinky behold.
