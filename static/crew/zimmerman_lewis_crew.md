Fleet Boss Battles are the greatest thing to happen to Zimm since Haley the Hologram.

Position Trigger, meet Borg Sphere 878 — his +10 attack boost is just what the Emergency Medical Hologram ordered. In a world where beating up the Big Boss requires maximizing damage done per battle thanks to the limited Valor drip, his 6s Initialization time allows him to be paired with some Boom and/or +Crit crew to help lay a beating on the Hard Difficulty level that doesn’t let you use any Legendary Crew or Ships. He can do double duty for newer players with viability in Arena as well (check out the USS Shenzhou and its fast-activating position ability), which, combined with his placement in two difficult to complete stat-boosting collections (plus the limited pool, long-time player requested Pet collection), makes Lonely Lew a great Behold target.
