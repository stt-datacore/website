Fleet Boss Battles have shaken up the shipboard scene so you’re probably wondering if RPC is still worth the effort. Since you’re all going to die anyways, why not tell you? The answer is…

We don’t know how future FBB bosses will play out. In iteration one, he’s one in a sea of options and his limit on uses hurts. But he remains an arena and skirmish stalwart and despite lacking in other daily utility, his strong trait lineup sees him as a strong collection piece with a handsome number of event opportunities. He may lack the gauntlet ability of a Fury Kes or MACO Mayweather, but he’s still a fine option to fuse up for new players looking to anchor their ship lineups.
