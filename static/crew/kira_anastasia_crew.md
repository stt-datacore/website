‘Licensed to sit in cryo’ doesn’t have the same ring to it, but if you thought you’d be using a 2017 Super Rare crew on every voyage, well then we can’t help you. This is still a fine Kira variant, though, especially considering her age and lack of a third skill. More collections are bound to amass and she has a fantastic event count/skill set combo to eat your merits for quarterly thaws. Now fire up the dirigible, we’re getting out of here. Very slowly.
