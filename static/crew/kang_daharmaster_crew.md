There's something to be said for crew who exceed the sum of their parts. A collection spot, for example, is worth more if it's attached to someone that you can use in other places. A Klingon, for example, is worth that much more if they hit on another big collection. So it is with Kang whose three collections almost push him into being something of a value pick...almost.

Collection fanatics may be doing double takes at Kang and that's a reasonable thought to have if you're in the later parts of your Timelines journey with honor or behold capital to spare. But for everyone else, he's realistically a five-star investment to be one of twenty pieces needed to boost one skill by one percent. That's a lot of fractions which may lead Kang to be an irrational investment.
