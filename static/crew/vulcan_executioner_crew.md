Fantastic chest art (that phrase is now Big Book canon), but really Executioner is a filler card, right down to his forgotten Telepath trait. His bases matter more for what skill they are than their power level and should earn intermittent weekend play thanks to WRG's crush on the Vulcans and one or two of his other traits.

What may earn him a spot on your roster is 400% arena damage at 8 seconds without a trigger. Hitting his +9 attack there may be a pipe dream because of the stars required, but is a solid Skirmish option nonetheless and is a nice little value add.
