Clearly no-one told poor old Julian Bashir that the Zhian'tara transplants peanut allergies as well as personalities and memories, because hoo boy, this likeness is off base at best - compare this art to Racquetball or even CMO Bashir if you don't believe the prevailing community theory that two artists are at work on current Timelines cards; the difference is night and day, or Joran and Audrid, if you prefer a more on-topic comparison. And it really is such a shame because there's so much to like about this card, from the superlative skill set to the just-right voyage power, down to the smorgasbord of traits that you won't soon see repeated, and some Swiss Army instant ship damage, though if it's far from established meta parameters.

Even with power creep continuing apace, you can look directly at Stranded Quark if you want to see how this card is going to age - and just like Alexander Siddig, it's going to age god damn well. What's better is that the two don't share a single AM seat, so if you need two handy dandy skill bandaids, both could potentially ride on the same voyage, and all of Bashir's AM traits only crossover with significantly more boring cards. If you have him, he will ride, end of story, and though he may be DIP primary, Bashir's healthy event history coupled with Dax's pedigree, plus WRG's seemingly favourite trait Pilot (there are main cast cards with less event bonuses than Pilot) will elevate him to a nicely versatile shuttle operator, even if he probably won't rise above second string compared to your Janeways and Kirks.

It really is just such a shame about the art . . .
