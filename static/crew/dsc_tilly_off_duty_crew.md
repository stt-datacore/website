The #1 DIP stat for all 2* crew says a lot about her usefulness. Not-Killy is very nearly one of the most useful cards in the game. Her ENG stat isn't too bad either but don't stick around for her ship ability which sadly doesn't have as much use as her mirror counterpart. That said she wins with pure statistics and will be your goto for Missions and Voyages for quite some time.
