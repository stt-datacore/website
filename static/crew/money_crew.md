A one skilled minor MACO does not make a voyaging man happy. The 3rd worst 3* Voyager mostly due to her one skilled SEC stat. That SEC stat is strong and at some point you will have to warrant spending time on her to complete the weekend cadets, after that she's just a notch on the Veteran collection.
