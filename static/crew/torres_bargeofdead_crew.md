The newly minted Red Sonja of the Big Book - seriously, I doubt Roxann Dawson's hair was ever that red - Dead'lanna (we're still workshopping a pithy name) debuts with the kind of power that makes your Chroniton bank wince and your eyes bug out. Quite why WRG decided to torpedo players' investment in Orbital Skydiving Torres so casually and so quickly is a question for the ages, but for those of us who have gotten into the habit of squirrelling away a star or two on power crew for the inevitable winter season where everyone debuts in triple digit voyage ranks, we simply ask, why not run both? 

They did at least bother to change up the tertiary skill, so the outperforming of her reckless counterpart isn't quite complete, but B'Elanna's foray into Gre'thor has clearly left her so ripped she's going to tear targs in two and wrestle Molor herself - this is definitely the one you want if you have to pick. Breaking the glut of surrounding CDS crew with a hefty hyperspanner's worth of ENG, B'Elanna will dominate any roster's voyage seating thanks to six of her seven traits netting bonus antimatter, and befitting a crew that's technically already dead but hasn't quite passed on, power this firmly ensconced in the later losers category will never age. Compare her voyage rank trajectory with Skydiving Torres' relative plummet, and you can see why it pays to sit this side of that curve.

Continuing her effortless piledriving of her Orbital variant is her ridiculously huge SEC base, guaranteeing that B'Elanna's occasionally spotty event history won't come back to bite you, and if that weren't enough, she completes the daily use trifecta with a ship ability that can replace any arthritic Killy or Kes, easy. If you want to be picky, she's less than aces in Gauntlet and most of her collection value is already baked in, but it's really very hard to argue with a scorecard so green B'Elanna might remark that maybe you don't have to dive into six packs for great voyagers anymore - they just show up in events and look helpless.
