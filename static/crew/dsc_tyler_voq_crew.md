Tyler is an event primary, event secondary crew. You're likely looking under the couch cushions for help with the unwieldy Klingon collection, just be aware of what you're getting in Tyler should you choose to add stars to him. Double 1k bases in combination with Tyler, Klingon, and possibly Disco events should be enough to help you out on weekends a few times per year, even if his event tally bloated by six previous megas may be backwards looking.
