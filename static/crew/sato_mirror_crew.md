A low end event/collection piece that you can afford to pass on, Sato *could* improve the latter during WRG's collection era and she *could* be thawed for events despite her base ranking in the triple digits. But rosters young and old likely have other options to cover just about every conceivable avenue of usage that Sato provides. Until her potential collections become actual collections, kick the can down the road and let copies drift in from voyages or bad beholds.
