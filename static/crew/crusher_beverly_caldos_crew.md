Ghost ****er Bev (GFC) has arrived and meme-adjacent though she may be, she's managed to avoid the in-game point-and-laugh that names like Grebnedlog or Linus received. One of the most legendary scientists in the known universe gettin’ freaky with a candle...who'da thunk?

Her heady SCI base should find some non-bonus Faction event work and though Crusher herself hadn't seen an event bonus in the two years prior to Caldos' debut weekend, there's still some thin bonus potential here between main cast status and a lean trait set.

That same trait set will hit frequently for voyage anti-matter, though against plenty of competition, to help boost above average power. Think 2020's giveaway Homesteader Janeway with unreliable event bonuses, but stronger numbers and a hell of a personal log.
