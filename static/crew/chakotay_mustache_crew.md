The stats aren’t shabby, but Commander Generic makes variant number seven (of eight) with a CMD/DIP/SEC skill set. We welcome the unforeseen uptick in events (three in seven months), but beyond that there’s not much to recommend about the disheveled first officer. His art may be a shade off, but I must admit that a fairly bland character is represented accurately in this case. No fringe benefits so if you’re not using him for shuttles or voyages, freeze and forget until his event number is called.
