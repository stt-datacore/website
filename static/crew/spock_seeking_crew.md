Giant Intergalactic Space Probe seeking Spock is not what I was looking for in the personals, but here we are. 

Usable a little while longer on voyages thanks in part to his half dozen anti-matter traits, Spock is more known for his well-established event empire. Plenty of events year-to-year supplemented by traits which also grant him multi-collection status is value that endures and should keep him afloat as a behold option as he drops out of daily use contention. Now back to the paper - ooh Tellarite Seeking Zakdorn!
