Non-event CMD/DIP/SEC paints a certain picture on the behold page, but Gorkon is better than that. Two stat-boosting collections for which legendary crew are still required headline this card, while a huge arena nuke is probably the other thing that differentiates him. It's a beat slow, coming online at ten seconds and requiring a cloak trigger, but is a one-star option nevertheless. Base and voyage numbers are simply passable and may find use into the early endgame, but shouldn't be the reason you seek Gorkon out.
