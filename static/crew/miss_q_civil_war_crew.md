All Belle, no ball, this card stinks a bit of filler, though we might need to chalk that one up to the lack of Civil War era showers. Miss Q's not really a daily use option any longer, but her Collections in hand are tempting enough across from lots of Behold debris floating out there.

She'll have no trouble picking her seat in Events either, though obviously bonuses will come in unpredictable spurts. And for the true Plakson's Pals out there, Suzie is suitable for work on Ships as the leadoff Attack Booster for what's sure to be a unique and flavorful shipboard lineup.
