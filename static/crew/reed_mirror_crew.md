David Duchovny has the good fortune of collecting the Mirror trait (and associated traits) to boost his event count up into double-digits. With Mirror SEC stacked with equally unappealing options, you'd technically not be wrong to take him in a pinch for that reason, since it's not like the other cards are much better or worse.

On ships, 375% instant damage is a big torpedo, but getting to twelve seconds alive is increasingly difficult these days. Perhaps his best attribute, a spot in the newly minted Mirror collection, comes years after his release and is a nice value add if you want to finish perhaps the only worthwhile event piece that Reed has to offer.
