The Lady is theoretically an event/collection combo platter, though the back half of that hasn't appeared (yet). Her non-human traits all seem likely collection candidates and in the meantime they boost an otherwise underperforming event history for Crusher who saw her variant event tally double during just the course of 2021. She's more speculative than many low-level super rares, but one can easily see a path to improvement for her.
