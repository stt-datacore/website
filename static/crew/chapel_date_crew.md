This newly minted Super Rare crew may debut with no collections at present, but - no, wait, come back!

Date Night Chapel is a crew of pros and cons, to be sure. On the one hand, an immortalisation of a fun, even-handed reinterpretation of the Spock/Chapel relationship that's been of intense interest to Trek fans since the 60s; on the other hand, the art is . . . mismatched, to put it mildly, with awkward hand positioning and a face that appears to have been grabbed from a different still than the rest of the art, resulting in a somewhat uncanny effect. On the one hand, the voyage power is there, especially since four of her seven traits hit for bonus antimatter and a sprinkling of MED/SEC never goes amiss - for newer players, the event might be worth ranking in on that basis alone. On the other hand, a strong DIP primary is nothing exciting, and today's #5 DIP base will be tomorrow's #35 thanks to the raw pace with which they get pumped out.

So it goes with the traits. Romantic, Casual, Counselor - these aren't your standard bargain basement traits, these have hit event bonuses before or are small enough that they could fit into a niche collection . . . but as the Deep Space K-7 bartender would remind you, twice nothing is still nothing. Perhaps it's for the best that Chapel is a freebie in the ranked rewards for a surely competitive event - the Big Book wouldn't in good conscience advise spending Dil for her otherwise. Equip her and freeze her at your convenience, or wait for a portal update, either way, you're basically just using her as a way to fulfil your crew equip and training dailies until one of her traits eventually hits a collection. If we hear about a WRG employee getting bitten by a malamute named Milo, you won't have to look far to know why . . .
