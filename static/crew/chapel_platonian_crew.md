A Spock-adjacent character once again sees his famous quote rearing its inconvenient little head, “After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting.” Platonian Chapel found that out the hard way in her episode and now we are seeing this happen in game.

A plus Skill set has drooped into decrepit territory on Voyages unfortunately, and as Chapel moves from the daily use on Voyages part of the crew age bell curve and onto the Events/Collections portion, her Skill set actually hurts her. 

MED-led Skill sets don’t translate well into Event Shuttle proficiency given the dearth of MED seats, and her SCI Secondary isn’t much better. However, if her bonuses come in Chapel, Nurse, or Physician bonus Events, we could see a little extra in those two Skills on available Missions. So don’t lose heart!

Chapel’s Collection profile is mostly potential ones as it stands, but if her viable Traits pay off, she’ll have a quartet to play with.
