Surface level ranks for Sign Language Tuvok AKA Dikembe Mutombo Tuvok AKA Onevok AKA Hook 'Em Horns Tuvok AKA 'What are you doing in such a filthy uniform?' Tuvok are not impressive. So despite a fairly uncommon skill set at the super rare level, you'll want to take advice from his arena ability and play the long game.

His value blooms post-cryo in the form of double collections and in being one of two serviceable DIP options for Tuvok shuttles (sorry, Tuvix). Newer players can afford to pass on this six pack offering and continue collecting event crew while long time players have another purple to keep an eye out for when he hits the portal, if not before.
