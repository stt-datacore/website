He’s not sure what to do with his hands, but we can be sure what to do with him - stick him on shuttles! Between an impressive event clip headlined by two plus Riker weekends in each calendar year, and a CMD base that sits nearly 200 points above the next purple Riker, he should be the first name out of the freezer when his character's number is called.

A CMD/ENG stack that's underrepresented on voyages among super rares, +9 arena attack (trigger needed), and stat-boosting collection spot all combine to give him something to do in between Faction duties. For just one crew slot and 34 cents a day, you can help provide warmth and shelter for Rikers just like this one. Call now.
