Is one of the finest admirals in the fleet a good choice for your roster? That's a stupid question.

Ok, that joke landed better on release, but Patrick is still a fine Collection/Event crew. His Traits encompass his spotty Event work and, more tangibly, a Collection count that should land somewhere between two and four - not bad for a crew who you can still use outside of cryo from time to time.
