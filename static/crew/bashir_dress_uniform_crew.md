Welcome to Star Trek Timelines, where the points are made up and the traits don’t matter - or just don’t make sense. Despite being on Section 31 business at the time, he doesn’t count for either that faction or as an undercover operative, which is something of a shame. That being said, a MED/SCI voyager with a respectable event tally and the usual dual Bashir collections is still an extensive portfolio. For early to mid game rosters for whom this combination of skills is a little rarer, he’s going to be extremely valuable and likely to be phased out only by legendary crew. Even then, ‘phased out’ means thawed on a semi-regular basis for event work.
