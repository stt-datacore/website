Pinocchio may have Vreenak triggered, but the not-quite-real boy at least has some very real usability in game. Respectable voyage metrics and an uncommon skill set frame Roger Rabbit's most likely contribution to your roster, while some collection value and intriguing traits give him at least some kind of parachute once he gets ejected from your voyages..

The value of his SCI base will vary depending on the sort of roster who wants to immortalize him, but it does rank favorably against the current options for possible trait event bonuses such as Android, Physician, and Undercover Operative.

With uncertain long term relevance, but still some chances to bolster a few tricky voyage stacks, Korby is best treated as a short-term fusion project, if indeed you do want to finish the mechanical man to boost voyages or your whimsy collection.
