He might live in cryo while we’re all Pine-ing away for another Kirk variant fusion crew to Humpty Dumpty James Tiberius back together again, but Kirk event bonuses are as constant as the Northern Star and Evil's shuttle friendly skill set is the perfect accompaniment.

There's little other meat on the bone for this 2-skiller and his collection value has a trait limit to it, but owning a spot in at least one keeps him floating above tier:Trash flotsam and should be a name for veterans to acquire as his weekend work will help you out with big Faction event pushes.
