Without the emotional attachment of a main cast character or an eye-popping voyage number, it's understandable that this 6-pack offering was passed over by many, but Commander Exodia bn Bem is almost as fun to use as he is to say. Some side dish voyage power belies it's overall rank as bn Bem boasts a unique skill order as the only SEC/SCI gold with a MED tertiary.

But it's the gauntlet where Mr. Bemjamin will make hay. A top five proficiency total, #2 SCI roll, and three ranked gauntlet pairs are all assets that you're likely to find very useful. He dodges Armus, his SCIperior, rather well, but there are a lot of big names at the top of the gauntlet power ranks and most have SCI, SEC, or both.

His traits, which matter much more for the gauntlet than voyages in this case, have never recorded a crit value above 25%. That's a problem when almost all his surrounding competition can claim at least the occasional 45%+. He's a step down from monsters like Locutus, Caretaker, and Defensive Phlox, but the fact that he's even in the conversation with them is good news.
