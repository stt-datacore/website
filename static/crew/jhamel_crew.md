Shran's partner in Jhamelharon could have been a much better card. The MED makes sense, sure - the DIP, absolutely; you could have swung in the direction of SCI for a tertiary, or perhaps, if you were feeling cheeky, maybe even CMD, since she operated a drone ship telepresence unit (you kind of had to be there). The latter combination could have even proven quite titillating on voyages with the right numbers.

But alas, her value is as obscured as her face, seen only through a veil of traits. While Jhamel’s arena evasion has the requisite numbers to be usable, it’s really traits that are the driving force for the rest of this card.

With a laundry list of ‘viable’ traits, Jhamel could go from zero to hero at any time on the weekends, at least in spurts. Given her extended stretches of irrelevancy so far, it may also be an ephemeral dream and part of why she’s not exactly a coveted crew. More tangible should be her collection climb which starts at a middling number as of this writing, but doesn’t wax and wane in value like events do. If she comes close to her ceiling in this area, she’ll be that much more attractive in beholds and may even start to make retrieval lists.

Until she does, and I'm sure Shran would challenge me to the Ushaan for saying it, she's the Legendary equivalent of an Amanda Grayson most of the time and easy to avoid in the same fashion.
