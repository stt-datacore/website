A Jack of most trades, this Sisko tops no power charts, but contributes in almost every area. His trait tendrils run throughout the card, boosting his voyage credentials via a six-pack of anti-matter traits and his non-HFS traits have all had at least one event bonus previously.

Bankable event work looks extra appealing with his variant-best bases, even if his skills aren't those you'll most often see on Sisko event shuttles (it only takes one seat). Debuting with two of his four 'eligible' traits ticking a collection box, it seems only a matter of time before the others join them and make him a juicy collection/event pairing who will ride out the waves of waning voyage power to deliver long term value.
