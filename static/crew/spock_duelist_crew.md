Though SEC/SCI is well known as a useful skill set, he lacks the voyage power to make an impact beyond the early game. Thankfully, his hefty event count (including three features) and +1 Vulcan make him an occasional contributor on even established rosters. A slow-activating instant damage with good passive crit may find work in skirmishes. A fairly easy build by Spock standards - make sure to ad-warp some cadet missions to meet his 40 2* IDIC requirement.
