We all remember the road not traveled. Chances never taken. Giant space worms not ingested by. But then again, we’re not Kirk and his mama didn’t raise no punk.

Kirk’s scorecard on release looks like a Simone Biles olympic routine, all tens. Except that damn Russian judge. A reward crew exclusive to Fleet Boss Battles, it makes sense that Kirk debuts as our top rated shipboard option. Fast activation, big attack boost, plentiful instant damage, and most importantly no limit, all combine to make him an elite choice in any phase of the game involving ships. You might regret all that ISM you spent on those MACO polestars.

Voyages are also generous to Kirk. The top dog by score, his CMD/SEC/ENG skill set is among the most plentiful, but his Antimatter chances (taken) are strong for a non-MED crew and the power, besides being undeniable, should see him hold onto the upper ranks for several years.

The name Kirk tells you all you need to know about his event work as well, helping to tie a bow on a crew who will be a pillar of the game for years to come. If this were an event crew, you’d be coughing into the phone to cancel your weekend plans in favor of tapping ‘til your finger fell off.
