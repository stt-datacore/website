Dating back to biblical times and the legendary Samson, a man's mane has always been the seat of power. The courageous crown, the sagacious skull, the notable noggin. Throughout history, from Zeus to StarsAndGarters, a powerful pelt has imbued its owner with the strength to conquer feats that no mere mortal could conceive of.

So it is with Doctor Van Joe. Made of space-age holographic fibers, Doc's duster was designed to repel anything; rain, wind, snow, and especially young women. And so Van Gogh has channeled that Sickbay solitude into his mastery of engineering and science.

His decidedly televangelistic hairdo comes replete with some ENG/MED mastery and voyage numbers that are still strong enough to find work in combination with a plus skill set for those tricky voyage pairs. His black sheep ENG primary for events and peripheral perks in the form of triple collections and plus traits further serve to elevate base and voyage ranks which might flounder with a lesser skill set or...frankly...a lesser man.
