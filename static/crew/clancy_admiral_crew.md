Sitting across my desk is a Tilting Point employee giving me the pitch about a new Picard character. But she lacks the meme-able slogan attributed to her, her stats are a paltry reflection of her commanding prowess and the employee swaggers in with the balls and authority trying to sell me on this garbage idea?

Sheer...Fucking...Hubris

We knew Clancy was going to be a common set due to her stakes as a Starfleet Admiral however TP have still done her dirty. Barely breaking top 50 for CMD base stats should be a crime for any new card and her poor secondary and tertiary do nothing to make people want to invest in a potential Picard event candidate. Her one event where she would be useful has sailed into obscurity and her one small Gauntlet Pair is overshadowed by most cards literally given away in the last year. Seriously "The Hubris?", get some balls devs and put the full-fucking slogan in.
