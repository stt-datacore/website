Darth Bashir is sure to elicit a few "Back in my day"s as a former mega crew, so double check his current metrics to make sure you have a fresh perspective. Jules is no longer a competitive voyage option and shouldn't be running any shuttles without a bonus for you, but strong collections and fairly steady events are still worth taking home from the portal.

It's safe to say that Bashir's value has peaked (save for that niggling little potential Desperate collection), so while he's still a fine crew to acquire, do so for his long term benefits and accept any daily use you may come across as a bonus.
