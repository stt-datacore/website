My-First-Nog is a strange card. Not quite representative of the character it manifests. A fairly adequate ship ability mixed with decent SEC and DIP stats means you will probably get quite a bit of use out of him in the early game. He fills the Ferengi collection out, however, he is an absolute pain to equip, requiring 35 faction items from the various Ferengi shops. However heâ€™s a good beginner card and his traits will get some normal nodes unlocked for your first time round.
