Poor MED and SCI bases are usually detrimental but his proficiency gives him some legs should you need a good voyage in that category. However there are quite a few option available with other blues holding much better and stronger combinations of that skill. He's an option should you be lacking but consider him a body to get the immortalisation count increased than actually useful.
