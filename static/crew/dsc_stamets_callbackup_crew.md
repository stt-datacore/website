Just what we want in our 2-skill crew - a big base and big event potential. Missing a few frills that elite 2-skillers offer, but he'll come pre-loaded on your Disco event shuttles where, true to form, you’re going to see his pool of variants multiply like particularly fruitful fungi. Just beware, if Disco events drop off, so does this card’s usefulness.
