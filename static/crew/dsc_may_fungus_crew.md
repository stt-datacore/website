May has often been a punchline for Timelines players and while it's true that non-main cast 2-skiller is not a portfolio you should be drooling over, there's still value here, especially for the veteran player.

Good collections and common shuttle seating for events automatically keeps her off of the no-fly list, but if you take a stroll through her event history, it's easy to understand why one would be hesitant to take the plunge. If there was ever a "They've already had their mega" crew, this is it. Only approach May as a behold choice if you know what you're getting into and are ok playing the long game.
