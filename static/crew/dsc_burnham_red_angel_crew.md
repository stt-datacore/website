This Burnham variant put the entire game on notice when she debuted and made her first order of business chomping a huge bite out of a previous gauntlet exclusive in The Caretaker. Outright stealing an exclusive’s best pair is unheard of and she doesn’t stop there - also ruling over the DIP/ENG options and nearly going blow for blow with the DIP/SCI leader. She has incredible coverage flexibility and along with Locutus is one of two crew who can truly dominate multiple skill pairs at once in the majority of gauntlets.

Acting as a 'Bank error in your favor - Collect 200 points' when she hits 45% crit, Red Angel also owns more elevated crit gauntlets than any other crew in the top fifty overall proficiency. She may not reach Balok’s absurd level of “Take him and his four dupes” with his myriad 65% crit gauntlets, but she has a higher, safer floor than any other gauntlet crew and every roster should be so lucky as to win her early on in their Timelines journey to stabilize that area of play.

Beyond gauntlet, Burnham's second step is not a doozy like Balok or Armus. She holds up well on voyages with a worthwhile overall score and seven different anti-matter traits. Her set of collections is an immediate roster-wide bump thanks to the Gauntlet collection's exclusivity and with Burnham's clockwork event bonuses, makes her an understandable citation candidate if you're not particularly lucky with gauntlet drops. And, oh yea, her art is pretty frickin' cool. If you're reading this because she just dropped for you in the gauntlet, congratulations - you're in for a ride.
