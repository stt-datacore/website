Voyage numbers are one of her few weak spots, though if you snag multiple copies through a re-run of one of her three featured events, she may still serve you there. A tough Borg collection and usable ENG base for her events is fairly quality long term value. For daily use, you might notice her gauntlet numbers which are good for super rare crew and still hit 65% crit after the trait reshuffle, even though she only has three traits. The price to pay for that versatility is a hefty sum of 3-4* components, like most Borg crew. Newly attainable through Episode 9's Borg victory, and definitely the superior crew reward, provided you don't mind missing out on some ship battle loot.
