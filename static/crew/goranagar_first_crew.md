A great CMD base, but his other stats and skill set don't measure up. Voyage numbers that might play in a different skill set end up rather replaceable, even by decent 1/5s. +1 Veteran and a growing number of Dominion events for when he can't contribute on shuttles any longer are attributes that you'll want to collect eventually.
