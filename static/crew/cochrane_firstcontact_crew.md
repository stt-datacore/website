An old crew who's popped up as a giveaway multiple times in the past, if you're one of those players who have a few stars on him already, don't feel bad about tacking one more on. A fairly strong trait set has performed admirably for event opportunities thus far and grants him a worthwhile mix of immediate and potential collection value.

If you're staring at his first star, however, don't expect much usability day to day outside of some replaceable arena evasion. If you're in the market for a crew you can actually use rather than set on the collection shelf to gather dust, Cochrane's numbers will let you down.
