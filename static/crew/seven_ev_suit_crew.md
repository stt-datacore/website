If we're taking a 'tree ring' retrospective kind of look, this Seven variant launched right before someone at WRG spoke up and said, "What if we give Seven variants actual bases from now on?"

The last (as of now) in a storied line of gauntleteer Sevens, EV Suit is far from dominant or even as impressive as Rifle Seven was back in the day, but her handful of really quite exclusive 45% gauntlet crit sets allow her to excel in skill pairs that are often times crowded with bigger, meaner rolls.

Outside of the Tsunkatse pit, EV Suit does alright with some event/collection 1-2 punch action. Her bases are bad, but she can fill seats with a bonus and enough stars, while a few collections await her once fully fused. A worthwhile and versatile, if underpowered package.
