Rather milquetoast numbers for 'Leather Daddy Lorca' (not my moniker). Like all Discovery crew, he comes out of the box with a huge event tally, further boosted by the Mirror trait. But that’s where the appeal ends.

A skill set you don’t need more of meets disappointing voyage numbers and bases that won’t see much event use unless he’s carrying the bonus tag. With non-existent peripheries in the arena, gauntlet, and collection tab, he’s mainly a weekend helper whose usefulness hinges on the RNG Dabo wheel of event bonuses.
