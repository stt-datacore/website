Pure SCI ability isn’t everything as demonstrated by Gilora here. One of my most used cards in the early days of the game due to her work in all Cadet missions, a healthy #4 SCI base stat and two extra collections. Her broad skill set gives her plenty of work during Voyages. Her ship ability is fairly good with a +1000 shield regeneration bonus but her main use will be in Cadet missions. If you fancy your hand at Gauntlet she might just help you get a streak or two. Just keep her away from O’Brien, there could be...tension.
