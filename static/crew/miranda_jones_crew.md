Pre-Pulaski smokeshow Jones may be neuralizing you with her sequined dress and handsome charm, but cover your eyes and scan her stat metrics instead.

None of her numbers are even average and DIP/SCI is not hurting for representation. One of only four traits have activated weekend usefulness (Vulcan) and it's hard to see that happening many more times. If you want her for any semblance of game value, it's going to be solely for collections.
