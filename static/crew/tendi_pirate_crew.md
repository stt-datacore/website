It's often said that if you're going to pull a crew from a six pack, they should shoot to the top of your priorities - you spent the Dil, so you should feel the benefits as soon as possible, especially in a game with high crew turnover like this. Tendi turns this adage up to 11, debuting with an absolute banger of a skill set, a spot in two niche collections and a massive third one where you'll need all the help you can get . . . and then leaving you otherwise pretty much completely cold. With voyage stats these good, she'll do work on any 4* roster until the game ends, but the rest of her value is laid out for you front and centre - unless Tendi turns out to be the Janeway or Kirk of Lower Decks Faction events, this is a card that will never get better; only worse.
