Locked, cocked, and loaded since the Big Book was a twinkle in my eye, we can finally proclaim; Headin' out to Eden, Yeah Brother! This Pike hits the triumvirate of base, voyage, and event power while graciously sporting a splash of SCI to avoid the dreaded redundant skill set of redundancy. If you're after a crew comp, look no further than the former campaign offering Professor Sato. They share a skill order so Pike is a voyage upgrade in almost every category while also septupling her event count at the cost of owning a merely mortal DIP base.

If you're a free-to-player who's hurting for big DIP due to a lack of strong mega DIP crew, Pike is someone to grab a copy of and even star up, and while that advice used to come with some uncertainty as to Disco event eligibility, you can rest easy and nuzzle up into that handsome DIP base, safe in the knowledge that Pike just charmed his way into the hearts of fans and CBS execs, snagging a whole spin-off show for himself and his shipmates. As investments go, there are few names I'd feel safer betting on.
