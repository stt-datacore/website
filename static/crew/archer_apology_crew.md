Card art showing Scott Bakula's frontula (someone fan me) is not even the most impressive part of this crew. Let's start with that great base DIP rank. Keep in mind that it's still miles behind #1 Sato, but he'll pip any other option and though his event chances are merely average, DIP is a common enough Faction seat for him to pick up non-bonus work from time to time and have his own private chair for daily shuttles. 

On voyages, he's a fantastic counterpart to former megas Cornwell/Bashir and even maintains a strong MED/CMD rank despite being DIP primary. In the gauntlet, though far from dominant, he owns a top three ranked pair and may make your starting five should the traits align in his favor. Hitting on several areas with good numbers, Archer is an elite daily use crew who we can only hope has a sharp uptick in events.
