Worf has a lot of "blah" versions and, unfortunately, Niners is no exception. His skill set and voyage/gauntlet numbers are total duds. The vanity collection is there if you want it, but his best area of contribution is going to be as the #2 Worf SEC base. He does have the well-known Protomorphosis variant ahead of him, but will still perform fine for Faction events, even from lower star counts.
