One Ron Canada (what a name) brought to life this virtuous Malon from Voyager who unfortunately is only a collection popsicle stick. The lure of otherwise useful arena evasion is shot down by an attack handicap leaving his best chance at usability residing in the bowels of a Romantic/Inspiring mega where heâ€™s a reasonable ENG option for those traits. Vets will love Fesek, new players can afford to beam him aboard at a later date.
