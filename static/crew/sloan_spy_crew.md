In the collection/trait era, Sloan is looking marginally better than he had previously. Still not a daily use option aside from a reasonable crit-centric arena ability, he’ll be banking on any one of his quartet of viable traits to grant collection value. Events are of course on the table, but most well-stocked rosters would find little use in thawing his mid-2017 bases.
