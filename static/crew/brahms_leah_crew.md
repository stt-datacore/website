"Every time you look at the SCI/ENG voyage ranks, you're looking at me." The bi-annual refresh card comes in many flavours, and Ms. - sorry, Mrs. - Brahms' flavour is, unfortunately for those of you with a penchant for Susan Gibney cards (come on, Benteen!), decidedly vanilla. Perfectly serviceable base and voyage ranks continue to be precisely that, but the trajectory always tends to trend downwards when you debut at merely serviceable.

The only traits that don't state the biological facts (Human, Federation, Starfleet, Civilian) have both been tapped for megas, and outside of a one-off down the road, there's as much of a future for Leah as there is for Geordi's love life without the intervention of a godlike being. The arena evasion is nice, but slow and laden with a trigger requirement that might as well leave it DOA in the current ship battle meta. See Erickson, Emory, for an idea of what she was to your roster just a short time ago.
