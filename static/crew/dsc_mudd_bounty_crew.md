This Mudd is better known for his art than anything statistically (They're real and they're spectacular). That's not to say he's a dud card, but he doesn't offer anything particularly unique. 

His strong trait lineup is the headliner here. While the two-bonus Courier mega with he and Morn doesn't seem terribly likely, simply stockpiling non-HFS traits is not unreasonable and already he's compiled an impressive event portfolio, Discovery megas aside.

Despite drifting through his twilight voyage years, Mudd is the type of crew who can age well on the back of his traits, which makes him a situationally worthy behold choice, though a lukewarm reception is understandable.
