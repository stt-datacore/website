Don’t be fooled by the unicorn Skill set and the amazing uniform; the sun has set on Delta Flyer Paris as a daily use crew. Tom is a bankable Event name and his various Traits have given him a handful of bonuses on weekends every year except for the years where WRG forgets he exists (looking at you 2019 and 2021). Traits are the name of this game, and Tommy boy has two Stat-boosting Collections as it stands with a slot in the Lucille Davenport-rewarding Holodeck Enthusiasts, plus four more likely Traits in his jumpsuit pockets. If you invest in this crew it’s for his ceiling, not his past.
