2018 was the year of Andoria and gave Lissan and her kind a glimmer of hope, but has since then proved to be a flash in the pan. Her 1100+ base is quite adequate for event work, unfortunately it's tied to traits that would seem to support spotty weekend relevance at best. On the daily use front, she leverages two fairly even proficiencies into a top five gauntlet pair, though she caps out at 25% gauntlet crit. We like to see at least one big roll for our gauntlet crew to pick up wins against odd combos and 1-for-2s, but when her traits align, she's usable as a 5th gauntlet crew.
