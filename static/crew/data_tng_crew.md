One of the strongest Uncommon ENG bases makes up for an average SCI and SEC, combining to bring newer players some good early game Voyaging. Some useful traits will help tick off a few Galaxy map nodes (as well as Cadet Mission ones…shhh, he’s apparently an Alien and we won’t speak of this further) while providing an always welcome 2* Immortalization for a tricky Collection.
