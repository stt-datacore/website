A monster trait and event tally buoys a pair of now-average bases to far more relevance than your average 6-pack flavor of the week crew. He also has a shot at everyday use with the premier defensive ability in the arena for anyone who was lucky enough to miss out on former mega Minuet.

WRG's collection expansion favored Spock's Vulcan trait early on, giving him a chunk of value there alongside Jury Rigger. Despite lacking the everyday use that he might boast if he had competent voyage credentials, Laborer is the rare 2-skill gold who's justifiable as a behold choice.
