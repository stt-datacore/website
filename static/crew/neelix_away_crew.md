Chef. Morale Officer. Crack Commando.

Ok, maybe not so much that last one. But he does offer an impressive-for-an-Uncommon-crew 150% Instant Damage in Ship Battles, so he’s no pushover on a new player’s roster. He’s got Collection value up the wazoo (a vestigial Talaxian organ, actually) and a trait list that could see a couple more, giving him a bit of extra impact for anyone’s Cryostasis Vault.
