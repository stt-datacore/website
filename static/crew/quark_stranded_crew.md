DIP/ENG/MED is one of the most important skill sets in the game by virtue of it being so scarce. Only two (super rare) crew share it and even if other names trickle in, that won't do much to diminish its authority. Still lagging leagues behind the pack in terms of power is the ENG+MED pairing. With so much of its representation scattered between the secondaries and tertiaries of various crew, any semblance of power has a great advantage over other, thinner options.

Enter Stranded Quark; a valuable voyage piece for any of his skill permutations with a soft projected fall in desirability thanks to that pristine skill set. Quark is equally desirable for events thanks to a sizable variant event footprint, handful of traits, and the possibility of a Ferengi mega, wherein all three of his bases would be a top two option.

In the gauntlet you generally want a bit more room to maneuver than a single ranked pair, but he racks up plenty of 45% gauntlets and is in the right skill combo to try and knock off The Caretaker to add a bit of value to an already outstanding card.
