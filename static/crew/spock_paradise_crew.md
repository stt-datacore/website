"I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life...I was happy."

Ouch…um, well, Spock…hate to break it to you but this variant is merely a Super Rare, eventually destined to the cryo-vault for all but the most staunch Nightmare Mode Players…

DON’T BE SO HASTY, BB WRITER! The Berthold Rays haven’t had their week of influence yet, and in such time Mr. Spock here will have his impact on many a roster in the meantime! That’s right, dear reader, High As A Kite Spock here has some potential impact on your game, especially if you’ve not entered the ranks of Elderly Player just yet. Extremely respectable Voyage scores for a Super Rare Crew combine with assured Event use over time, be it by name or by trait, meaning that there are far worse 4* crew to obtain and level. He’s not going to do anything for you in Gauntlet or Ship Battles, but if you find yourself a copy, and Legendary Crew aren’t yet your go-to characters, you have yourself a man who can do a lot of daily legwork until such times as your Captain hurls all sorts of racist crap at you so that you shake off these crazy spores…
