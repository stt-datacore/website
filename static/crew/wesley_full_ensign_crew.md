This card completed the trifecta of all Wesley Crusher cards being pretty terrible. Well okay, there is some small merit with Ensign Crusher here having a less-than-average voyaging score. But really it’s only good if you don’t already have literally any of the other 3* SCI or ENG cards. He is not eligible for weekend cadet missions and no additional collections. His one useful trait will help unlock a node but that’s about it. A few premium pulls down the line will nab you a better SCI/ENG crew if you don’t have one already. Usually at this point in my rants about terrible Wesley cards I suggest upgrading for the 4* variant but I won’t do that this time. If Wesley ends up in your roster for longer than a month, consider your life choices…
