Slash fiction writers be praised, it's the handsome Kirk I've...I mean...you've been waiting for! Another exceptional Kirk enters the fray, this time setting his sights on the Engineering sections and proving that a good captain should be masters of all domains. His CMD/ENG scores high enough in both shuttle and voyage metrics to be on an almost even keel with the best that the skill combo has to offer.

His event count, like his Shatner-esque colleagues, is in excellent standing, though we're still waiting on DB to offer a few more ENG seats for his character. If you've been mulling starring up another ENG crew to bolster voyages or shuttles, Kirk's event pedigree guarantees Laborer to be a great investment.
