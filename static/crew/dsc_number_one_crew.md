Since Majel 2.0 has sunk from the ranks of viable Voyagers, we have to scrutinize things a bit more for cards that offer little else.

The “little else” includes a top three DIP/ENG Proficiency roll in a handful of Gauntlets, but just like Discovery, Burnham is going to hog the screen time whenever that Skill pair pops up and so Bex is limited to being a new player offering in that area. And, of course, the crossed fingers we have for Strange New Worlds and any boost to relevance for Ms. Romijn’s (like the lettuce) character.

A low Collection ceiling and limited Event chances outside of variant bonuses don’t buoy Smelly Number One (Bridge Officer = BO = Body Odor, get it?) for the long term, so tread lightly.
