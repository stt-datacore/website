No one will blame you for being fresh out of Dominion faction items - there simply aren't that many crew in the game to justify flying those shuttles very often. The fact that Third needs almost a hundred of them means you'd better warm up your replicator and prepare for a garbage return on investment.

Sunday cadet eligibility is his only saving grace, but he's not worth the effort it takes to equip him just for that. Keep taking the airlock's honor payment until his traits see him included in more than the (vanity) Rare crew collection.
