To not mince words, this card is old and weak. But he's also a reasonable investment the earlier you are in the game. At that point, his gauntlet ability should still play and help you get a foothold in that area, despite later being stomped by superior crew in a loaded skill set. And it would also give his collection slow cooker time to reach fork-tender status as the odds are good he'll end up with three of them before too long.

A relatively highly rated event crew off the back of Kirk's impressive event (and Faction) tally, you may not plug him into shuttles until his final star or two, but he's as good a bet as any to avoid long droughts with zero event relevance. Kal-if-fee is an inverse bell curve for value and a name to avoid if you're in the mid-to-late game just looking to acquire and star up strong daily use options.
