“(I amar prestar aen…) The world is changed: (han mathon ne nen…) I feel it in the water, (han mathon ne chae…) I feel it in the earth, (a han noston ned gwilith.) I smell it in the air...Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.”

Three game uses were given to this Super Rare Trill: immortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings. First, in Events: her bevy of traits and strong skills will come in handy for all who are graced by her long-lived beauty. Second, in Shuttle use: among the upper echelon in both DIP Base and DIP/SEC pairing. Third, in Voyages: able to carry young rosters still searching for Legendary crew and the ability to cite them.

As she departs to Valinor, post-Trill Mega for many players, she’ll leave behind traces of that which was Nenya: an everlasting place in 3 Stat-Boosting collections (with room, perhaps, for 3 more), including the all-new racial trait that is Trill.
