The “Made For Gauntlet” Crew from the 2024 Convergence Day Objective Event, T’Pol is also made for Collections. TPG chucked a bevy of Traits onto this T’Pol, so when one of her FORTY EIGHT Gauntlets with elevated Crit pops up (twelve at 45% or more), look for walls and walls of T’Pol to frustrate you and drain your Merits to refresh past her.

She’s the only non-Exclusive in the top ten Gauntlet ranks, and she won’t join the Time Portal for 12-18 months, so snag your copy from the Objective Event and chuck her into a Gauntlet! A no-brainer Citation Candidate as well, T’Pol has six Collections and two more viable Traits. Plus, if you’re looking for a little more value, check out the Ship Ability: 400% Instant Damage, shackled to a Position Trigger (the easiest of Triggers to scheme for), gives the new player and elderly player alike a chance to make a splash in Ship Battles.
