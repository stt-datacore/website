We already have a bad dad joke in the Big Book (Dick Bashir also appeared in Leucon's debut 6-pack), but at least this card's stats aren't nearly as despicable. Mark Sheppard fans (from every TV show ever) should feel vindicated when they happen upon this crew - he's got impressive voyage credentials to hand wave otherwise narrow utility and earn him long term roster usage.

His first few years in service were a gentle decline through the ranks thanks to top shelf debut numbers and while you might be lamenting a lack of MED for this bio-engineering geneticist, Leucon at least dominates his skill set competition on voyages.

The utility gulf is massive when looking for other contributions from this crew; the most notable of which is a ranked gauntlet pair which has a few 45% crit trait sets, but will be easily manhandled by The Caretaker and even global gift Survivalist Kirk and is best left to new rosters. Lacking the traditional HFS traits means that his collection count *should* steadily grow, but perhaps not quickly with his untapped trait pools either very large or small.
