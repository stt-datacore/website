A nice allrounder crewmember to help start your early game. This PokeCaptain fills out two collections from the get go and a nice helping of useful traits. Best used for early game Voyages but will outlive his usefulness once more potent rare crew come along. There is some merit to keeping him around for events as Picard does come up quite often (and with his own series on the way he’s sure to be useful)
