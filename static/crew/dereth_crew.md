It's not a Phage, mom! All right, good, we've gotten that out of the way, now we can talk about what's important - MED/SEC(s) appeal. It's a voyage combo that suffers from power gaps and infrequent updates just as badly as its cousin, MED/CMD. Indeed, there's a Dereth of good options, ranging from the big guns like Tactical Neelix or the EMA, before power gapping down all the way to the 'this is literally all I've got for this combo' gang, such as Mirror Phlox or Gladiator McCoy, so a new card to help out is always welcome.

Outside of his voyage portfolio, where he'll massively outperform his merely good rank thanks to just how badly populated his skills are (and the fact that he sports a completely unique order), he doesn't have a lot to offer - bad traits, a 25% Gauntlet set that will be crushed by 4* crew, and decimated event chances. But frankly? His voyage potential is what matters. If you've been pootling by with just Phloxes, it's time to upgrade, and let Dereth render you breathless in awe of what he'll do for your voyages.
