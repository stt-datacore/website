All right, who says it first? You say it first, I say it first? I'll say it first. The reason you're pulling on this six pack is because you can feel that Far Beyond the Stars collection coming, and the last time this happened, you had to watch as Scapegoat O'Brien fell into other people's laps. It's all right to admit it, it was traumatic for us all. Whether the FBTS collection will end up paying off in the end is anyone's guess (Darlene Kursky new #1 voyager?), but the thought is there, and that's arguably going to make the decision for you here, because there isn't a whole lot else to Roy to justify your Dil expenditure. Unimpressive voyage metrics, a paucity of traits, and an unattractive skill stack for a Martok variant mean that he's a niche pick for actual daily use, so choose wisely, friends. Unless, of course, you just really want that J.G. Hertzler chewing a cigar like he chews scenery avatar - I could think of far less reasonable uses of your hard earned resources.
