"Sometimes I wish I could boldly go where no man's gone before, but I'll probably stay in Aurora." Oh wait...wrong Garth. Hail to the populace, a mass produced version of Captain Killy has arrived as a mega-event christmas present! His Arena stats give a hefty 400% damage boost at 6 seconds without the evasion deficit, but lacking a top end attack boost may leave your smoking guns empty and lengthen battles that a superior option would have already mopped up. Still a great auto-include option to shorten your Skirmish bench, Garth is totally Baberaham Lincoln.

Base and voyage numbers are not entirely unhealthy for such a common pairing. No doubt he will beat out a few contenders avoiding their inevitable fate with a freezer but don't expect him to be the crucial part of a ten hour voyage. With little event future and middling rankings, outside of the Arena, if Mr Izar was an ice cream flavour, he'd be pralines and dick.
