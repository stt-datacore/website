In another strange statistical decision Mr. Paris has the highest CMD base for a 2* crew member but lowest MED stat in the game but the second highest MED max. Some useful traits might get him a node unlocked or two and his strange and rare mix of CMD/MED will fill a hole for voyages but has limited use in only MWF Cadet Missions (albeit they are the most important). He's weird but not needed when Kes and Phlox are about.
