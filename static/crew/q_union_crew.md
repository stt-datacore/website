A Jack of most trades, Qunion may not be the most conventionally powerful de Lancie card to have ever joined the game, but he’s certainly in the running for the most interesting.

Gauntlet headlines Q’s offerings to your roster where he fields two reasonable SEC pairs and oodles of crit potential via his traits. A half dozen 45%+ sets should pop up frequently enough and make it extremely difficult for you to leave him out of your starting five. Locutus is hiding under his bed and walls of the vaunted gauntlet exclusive may plague Q in low-crit situations, but as a rotational or new player piece, Q should have plenty of room to maneuver otherwise.

The same traits that make him a juicy gauntlet option also give him great collection potential, like many other Qs. Strong floor/ceiling value there makes the trip to five stars more worth it than for a lot of other “gauntlet crew” who sport poor bases.

Qunion also pitches in reasonable voyage ability. His raw power is perhaps pre-aged a year or two off of the instant cite names you normally chase for this area of the game, but his splash of MED and half dozen anti-matter traits should still give him intermittent usability on the majority of rosters.

Despite not receiving grades at the top of his event class, there will still be weekend work for Q. John de Lancie variant events now number in the double digits and that secret life-binding spice, traits, promises to help pad out bonuses year to year and give some fairly shuttle-friendly skills chances for spot work.
