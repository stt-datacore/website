There are some comparisons to be drawn to Mirror Jean-Luc; the skill pair, smattering of helpful traits, and the Picard name brand. But age is the lion on this wildebeest's back. Augment is not a daily use name by any stretch, leaving event work and collection worth in power creep's wake.

His handful of eventable traits and Picard's steady weekend work serve to elevate uninspiring bases, including a SEC which sits in the top ten for almost all of his weekend bonus opportunities. His long list of traits was also born to shine in WRG’s collection push and gives him as high a ceiling there as almost anyone. Considering the power level of your average Timelines' Originals crew, Picard is a fine choice to help finish that vanity and still retain some gameplay value after the fact.
