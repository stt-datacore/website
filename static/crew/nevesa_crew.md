Merely a filler crew whose value stems from her collections and inconsistent event work. Her first star offers some arena damage off cloak, but is replaceable without too much effort. Every roster will need to finish Nevesa eventually, but with dozens of faction items needed and not much payoff in the early game, you can afford to pass for more immediately relevant options.
