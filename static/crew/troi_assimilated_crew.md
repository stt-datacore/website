One of Troi's therapeutic traits caught a bonus to close out 2019, but it's her more assimilate-y buzzwords that have our interest piqued. Borg may (or may not) be in line for more weekend work via ST:Picard and the perennial baddies are due to pop up sooner or later regardless of TV futures. Paired with healthy Troi event work, this card's one weakness, bases, can still find work for many rosters.

Elsewhere, Troi is dynamite. Voyage work among the elite thanks to a beautiful marriage of skill set + power, double collections, and even 65% gauntlet crit capability available at one star for younger rosters. A grab bag of value worthy of behold capital.
