From the episode that launched a thousand spin-offs, Mirror, Mirror Chekov is the kind of crew who fits his on-screen role satisfyingly well.

A failed assassination attempt on Kirk (not enough Judo chopping) and a brief vacation in the Agony Booth during his sixty seconds of fame translates into sixty seconds of usability for that one (?) Faction per year he'll be thawed for thanks to variant and possible Mirror events. Behind the scenes, he's at least an integral part of the Mirror collection which will require legendary crew to finish for a long time to come.
