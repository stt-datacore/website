Eenie, queenie, miney...ah forget it. Po's event count reads like a Kirk or Jadzia and even if Discovery events were a house of cards, she has enough traits to power plenty of weekend work down the line. Those fistfuls of traits, with no Human, Federation, or Starfleet among them, also supercharge her collection value which has been steadily growing while showing no signs of slowing (cue Willy Wonka).

We're obligated to remind you that Po was a prior campaign offering and perhaps one of the best. She's chewed through a chunk of her voyage lifespan to date and will be dropping ranks with greater velocity, though some uncommon anti-matter traits and still-usable power gives her a while longer to contribute there. One of the best trait lineups in the game had enough power on release for Po to present an impressive value portfolio even years after her addition to Timelines.
