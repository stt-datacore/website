However, the greatest challenge may come from within, as the Vulcan High Command is opposed to the extreme tactics proposed for handling the Vezda.","rules":"-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- In this event, Gold and Silver skills for Voyages will be SEC and CMD. \n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using Vezda, any version of Batel, Gamble, Pike, Cosmic, or SNW crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the Asaasllich, the U.S.S. Farragut, the Galaxy Class Ship, or ships with the Explorer trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards.
