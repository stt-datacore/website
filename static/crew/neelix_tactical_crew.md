When a profile starts with dethroning Warship EMA, you should know immediately that we’re dealing with a crew who should not be taken lightly, even if, to be fair, it’s Neelix. Say hello to the #1 SEC/MED voyager, and to raw voyage power that the game has not made available outside of Tuesday packs since Captain Braxton. Tin Cup's voyage metrics across the board are gaudy and stellar enough to even make his 1300+ SEC base a footnote.

Which is understandable - Neelix is not a household event name and with some fairly esoteric traits beside, his chances to anchor weekend shuttles may be few and far between. Despite a decidedly negative utility profile, his voyage power is underrated even among top ten names and his bases will Hulk Smash what few event chances he can accumulate.
