Trock...spibble? is the crown jewel of 2021's Tribble mega. Huge base and voyage power, triple collections, event bonuses out the wazoo - there's not much this crew can't do. In contention for the best pound-for-pound Spock in the game, there's no point at which you should be unhappy to see him float across your viewscreen. He'll be worth building a star at a time through beholds and voyages, or even citing once you have you him.

Veteran players can generally afford to be more patient as the niche areas that might keep him in service longer (I.E. Ardra in arena or Mirror Phlox in gauntlet) are duds along with his voyage skill set). But the power is plenty to spackle over those spots, presenting him as a cornerstone crew for any newer rosters.
