When you're looking at a crew's selling point being Wesley Crusher events, you probably took a wrong turn in a really bad part of town. The entirety of Wes' pre-cryo value to your roster is summed up by a handful of Prodigy node unlocks on the galaxy map. Once those are clear, you can expect a thaw or two per year if there are enough SCI/ENG seats to go around.
