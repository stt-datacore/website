Saluti! Allow me to regale you with the story of Leonardo da Timelines. The first legendary to sport the ENG/SCI/MED skill set is not far off from turning three years old, yet he remains among the more effective crew in the game. His delicious trait m√©lange has afforded him enough cracks at the event wheel for our purposes as more should continue to trickle in from megas and one-offs. Fringe collection and gauntlet offerings add a bit of garnish to his main course; voyages. Though crew wearing his skill set now number in the double digits, the blessed union of skill set and raw stat total allow him to mantain his mantle of key voyage cog.
