Linear skill sets? What is this? It is inconceivable that any new card could be introduced this way. The prophets must be deceiving us.

Here we have the latest in a long line of CMD/DIP/SCI variants and frankly, not the most useful. Stepping on the heels of Mambo Picard is one thing but Jennifer variants are as slim as her beachwear as are her paltry range traits. That being said she is knocking on the door of 4K voyage power and if you are looking to extend into the 10 hour range and don’t have either Mambo or Awkward-Mother-In-Law Sarah Sisko then she could make a decent cite candidate on those merits. If she is part of your existence now don’t expect her to make many shuttles but she could ascend a voyage or two.
