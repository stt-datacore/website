Yar's great Faction event rate and pair of variant-best bases present her as a viable weekend tool for your arsenal, but it's her traits that have compensated for the understandable decline in power from this 2016 card. Several years of almost nothing but trait events have kept her relevant while her 1-2 punch of collections current and yet to come make her a tantalizing behold choice, especially against crew that may be stronger statistically, but are as boring as unbuttered toast.

There's also a 1-star node unlock (Pilot/SEC) and pair of 45% gauntlet opportunities to help out newer players as well. Yar remains well-rounded, but without top flight power to offer in any single area.
