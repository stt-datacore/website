"Does it matter? You get the one, you get that other one. Personally, I think the whole arrangement's a little..."

This is whimsy done right and fusion done wrong. The Bynars, a years-long punchline, may be having the last laugh during WRG's 'collection era'. All three having picked up a spot in the massive Resourceful collection already makes them worth acquiring to some extent and they have room for growth in that area.

The resultant legendary Bynar being, well, boiled ass means that you don't need to rush to finish them and can instead treat these purple purples as some handy frozen behold insurance and continue to select the pair in an otherwise dead-end behold.
