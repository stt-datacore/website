Late bloomer Archer will never be a major event player, but once WRG remembered that he's the Captain, he's had a fairly reliable number of variant events since. EV Suit is plainly a low power option, but with a good potential collection ceiling and the right skills to merit a thaw a few times per year.

He's in the mix as a low end behold option for the foreseeable future and could end up being a retrieval target in the late game to finish a handful of collections if things break right for him.
