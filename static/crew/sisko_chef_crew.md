A “five times fast” kind of name is one you should get to know thanks to Shoe Chef Shisko’s fantastic collection mélange. A sprinkling of galaxy map node unlocks and early game shuttle work are merely hors d'oeuvres for Chef’s main course; stat-boosters.

Already at the summit of collection power, the only crew who could chase him down if everything potential-ly breaks right would be that bloodsucker Khan. Even if you opt not to level Sisko right away due to a lack of cadet or voyage work, he still deserves to eat a crew slot while you finish your vegetables before having dessert.
