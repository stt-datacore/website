He might live in cryo while we’re all Pine-ing away for another Kirk variant fusion crew to Humpty Dumpty James Tiberius back together again, but Kirk event bonuses will always be in fashion and a Villain mega should surprise no one. He’s a useful, if unessential shuttle piece for a character with plenty of events and great Faction rate. But they didn’t even use the right picture for his art!
