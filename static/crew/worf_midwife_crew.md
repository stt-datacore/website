A somewhat backwards-looking crew, though not necessarily a poor one, Midworf debuted with iffy voyage power even considering his great skill set. By now he’s not really an option there and is only a stopgap arena choice, though he’ll perform fine as Ardra-lite for new players who may acquire several Stars of Worf at once.

Even his collection potential seems tapped out at this point. Nevertheless, he’s still a fine snag for said collections and his strong-for-MED base should earn him several thawpertunities in the future between various Worf weekends and mega events. It’s hard to see a world in which this crew sees an uptick in value, but he can coast on what he has for quite a while.
