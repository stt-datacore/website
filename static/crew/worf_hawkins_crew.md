I know we’re all looking forward to pulling our Willies in a pack, but this Worf variant is a bit more of a luxury than his stat ranks may imply.

Debuting in a month that saw a CMD/DIP/SEC mega recurring and CMD/DIP/SEC giveaway gold, Hawkins’ voyage seating opportunities are in worse shape than usual in practice. He’s not exactly a one trick pony - there are worthwhile base and collection metrics to bank on over time - just beware that he may be less well-rounded than his final score indicates.
