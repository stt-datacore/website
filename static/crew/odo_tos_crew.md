For some inexplicable reason, this pacifist Odo has the second best base SEC among Odos...you know, the Security Chief?! His DIP base is fine for daily shuttles and he sports fairly relevant dual bases for Odo's two events per year, but is a luxury event pick who only grants value after paying merits for his services.
