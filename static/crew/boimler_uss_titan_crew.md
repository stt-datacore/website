Sporting perhaps the longest name for a card in the game (and to think, they could have skewed longer if they'd included the full stops in the U.S.S. Titan), it's something of a shame that it's only thanks to the inclusion of Rare Badgey that Boimler is saved from being the worst Lower Decks card on debut. Even that is debatable, given the erstwhile Starfleet brand Clippy's collection value, but I digress. An ENG kicker, a decent base to bring to bear in potential LDS events to come, and a spot in the - for now - niche Animated collection are all that really save Boimler from obscurity, given his milquetoast traits, nondescript primary/secondary and lack of other redeeming features. Hopefully we have a better variant in the hopper, because right now, this is a bit of USS Titan Bradward Bummer to see.
