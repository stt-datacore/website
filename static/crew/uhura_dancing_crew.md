Most of us loathe the thought of collecting another DIP/CMD 2-skiller, but at least Uhura can contribute in spots. For a time, she was among the best shuttle crew in the game, but now crowded out of that honor by handfuls of later releases, she waits for events to boost her into action.

Limited in many areas by the lack of a third skill anyways, there's a chance that Uhura ends up as stronger value than when she started. A handful of non-HFS traits could hit and lift her long term value while likely throwing some mega or standalone events into the mix as well. Until that happens, however, she's almost purely speculative value with usability spikes few and far between.
