Who? Tau Ceti? Tau Cannon? One of several crew in a niche subset of cards which have strong shuttle and voyage numbers, but slim long-term utility and cost a bundle to fuse from a weekday pack.

If you just HAVE to have Tau for his role in everybody's favorite *checks notes* Voyager episode in which Janeway hang glides with Gimli while wearing a dress, then you'll be crossing your fingers for Saboteur, Criminal, or even Scoundrel to hit (again) on some Faction action down the line to give him value beyond the early-mid game.
