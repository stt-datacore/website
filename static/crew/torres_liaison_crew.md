If statistical minutia like #3 Torres DIP excite you, then Liaison Torres is the crew for you! More of a statistical punchline than even an early game contender, the vast majority of this card's value comes in the generous appending of Diplomat, one of the hardest collections in the game to max out, and the even larger Klingon. She's as close to an essential collection piece as it gets.

Outside of collecting skill boosts, she might be worth thawing for the odd Torres event if you have a surplus of merits, slots, and time, but only due to a lack of variants. Even with bonuses, these bases are pretty pathetic, and she'll leave you wondering why you bothered when you shove her back into the freezer.
