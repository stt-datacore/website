This fantastically loathsome villain certainly deserved more power for his part in one of everybody's favorite Trek two-parters. He's among the worse options for arena damage (but you HAVE heard of him) which leaves just the gauntlet as his only real chance for work. He parlays a top 20 SEC roll into a grand total of zero top 20 pairs. Hmm, well, I guess he USED to be good. If you select him for his deliciously hateable role in torturing Jean-Luc, then pray for a future Cardassian mega during which he can perhaps sneak his terrible bases onto a requisition shuttle.
