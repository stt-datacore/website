"Wild Girl Of The Woods" shouts our favourite pizza-wielding father figure to the huntress emerging from the forest. Brandishing the carcass of a future meal awaiting dissection, Kestra quickly becomes one of the newest favourite characters out of the fledgling new series.

Not quite matching up in game, Kestra is in wait-and-see mode for events, hoping to staff shuttles with a thaw-able SEC base should her eclectic trait set or Picard show eligibility ever hit (which they haven't, to date). Of value to everybody, however, is her spot in the expansive Costume Party collection where she's an obligatory immortalize to save you the cost of investing in a gold in her stead.
