A long while ago, a flood of Burnham variants, not all of them particularly stand out, led many to disparage the idea that we might get Burnham Looking Slightly To The Left - and, well. Now, here we are. Burnham Sitting In A Chair, which is totally different to Burnham Standing Doing A Vulcan Salute. That being said, as generic variants go, this is at least a good one - thin on traits, and for some reason missing Burnham's trademark Xenoanthropology, but a plus skill set, three collections out of the box, and enough voyage power to stick it out even as SR power creep continues apace means you'll want to grab the copies up for grabs even if Disco isn't quite your cup of tea. 

It's also worth noting two things: firstly, out of the Discovery regular crew, Burnham, Saru, and to a lesser extent Georgiou, tend to see the most variant work, so Jumpin' Jack Burnham is worth investing in just on that basis. Secondly, the Discovery collection was added at least partly because WRG wanted it to be easier for everyone to see their applicable bonus crew for this mega - and, presumably, future megas to come. Regardless of how her event work pans out in this ever changin' world in which we live in, the CMD base on offer here is worthwhile just to cover your bases, really. Get it? Cover your bases. All right, note's over, you can go home.
