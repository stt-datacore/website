In a time when SEC/SCI options consisted of Admiral Janeway and Maquis Tuvok, Laas was actually a reasonable voyage option for that tricky stack. Things have changed and power creep has left him with merely stop-and-start event chances and, more importantly, some unrealized collection value.

As of this writing, Laas only ticks the Survivalist box, but more are sure to follow and if you won’t use what’s offered by the behold options flanking Laas, he’s a fine low end dart throw who may grow in post-cryo value over time.
