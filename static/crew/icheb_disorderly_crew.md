Ahhh, poor Itchy. Seemingly forever consigned to the collection piece dustbin of history, this former Borg drone struggles to find a third skill most of the time, let alone daily relevance (unless you REALLY care about that Prodigy voyage seat). This disorderly variant isn't much different, serving mostly as a freeze and forget for most rosters that can afford to equip him quickly enough, and the most interesting thing about him is arguably the precedent he sets for other Ichebs - namely, the reminder that he was genetically engineered by Big Book confirmed Worst Dad™ Leucon, and thus can save you from finishing off at least one geriatric Khan or Bashir down the line. Whether his other cards will be adjusted to include this has yet to be seen, though the outlook, according to my Magic Icheb Eyeball, is cloudy. He does sport a relatively hefty CMD base with a half dozen traits that have and may well continue to hit both Events and Collections, but for those of you who have been playing for a while, they're mostly pools with mega crew or giveaways that will render him merely useable for events rather than essential. Hopefully WRG are kind and give us a truly good Icheb to remember him by before he runs out of Wesley Crusher sweaters with which to positively identify him.
