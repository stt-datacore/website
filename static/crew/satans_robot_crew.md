The last time I bet against Robot's event prowess, he whipped out his #1 Hologram ENG and beat me over the head with it for four straight weeks. For those of you who want to take him, I'll just say there's no way we get a Villain mega event, absolutely not! Unfortunately, that would spend two of his three traits and his daily shuttle work should be spotty at best with three ENG primary mega crew in the books. Q2 2019 stacked the deck with ENG/SEC voyage options, meaning Robot's future outlook is in serious danger.
