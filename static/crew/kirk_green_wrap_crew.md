An arguably transcendent gauntleteer at the Rare level, Kirk’s “viability” there says more about WRG’s plans for new rare crew than his standalone power. In any other skill set, Ol’ Green Eyes would be rubbing shoulders with purple proficiency options and indeed can help you get a toe in the gauntlet door. But he owns more of a token top ranking when the reality of the situation will see him pitted against crew with twice his overall proficiency.

Similarly, Kirk events will be plentiful, but he’s going to need more than a mere 2x bonus to match the base power of higher rarity options. Wrap’s stats are truly impressive for a launch card of his rarity, but you’ll have to strike early to get much use out of him as veteran players will be looking for more collection value when choosing who to level up with their spare trainers.
