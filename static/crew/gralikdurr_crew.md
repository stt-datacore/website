Tom Dwan is probably going to river four of a kind in the collections tab when it's all said and done, but already holding status as a multi-collection piece is Durr's saving grace. With almost zero usefulness otherwise (stop sending in photos from the ENT mega. We know), his beholds generally boil down to an equation of collection count vs. collection count.
