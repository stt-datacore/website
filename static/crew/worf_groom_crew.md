There is nothing more Romantic than a wedding in Timelines in the summer, when the Dabo is blooming. We are not afforded the luxury of choosing the crew we fall in love with. Do you think Worf is anything like the crew I thought Iâ€™d choose? He is an inept, shallow, arrogant man who shares my event shuttles far too frequently for my taste. And yet...I love him deeply. We at The Big Book often tout our prowess at rating crew, our desire for tiers and honor above all else. But how hollow is the sound of a skirmish victory without someone to share it with. Crew slots give little comfort to a man alone in his roster, and in his heart.
