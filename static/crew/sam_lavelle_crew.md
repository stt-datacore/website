At the Academy, Lavelle was voted Most Likely To Have Too Many Capital Letters In His Name, so that yearbook entry seems to have aged well. It's also good that Boimler 1.0 has some Great White North lineage, because he's going to need that +15 frost protection buff for all the time he'll be spending in cryo.

An event was the right place for Lavelle to debut - borderline voyage power and strong shuttle metrics will play well on new rosters when they come pre-fused rather than one at a time from a Tuesday pack. Outside of that, Sam is a dud and is going to need to pick up at least one collection before established rosters will give him a second glance.
