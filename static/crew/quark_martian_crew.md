Quark's event count blossomed in 2018 taking him into double-digits, but hasn't budged since then. With a future Ferengi mega a distinct possibility and the #1 Ferengi DIP (and #5 CMD) in his back pocket, he could be primed to be an impact player in the future. For now, he's a solid shuttle crew with an up and down event history.
