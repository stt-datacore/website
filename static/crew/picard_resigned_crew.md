A man of the theater, Sir Patrick should appreciate that anything he can do, they can do better. Buried behind *dozens* of variants at this point, Resigned owns poor bases and traits with a poor skill set to boot. Double digit Picards own a better DIP base (his primary) and Cultural Figure is his only trait to have provided an event bonus, which is unlikely to ever change. Aside from arena accuracy and replaceable voyage work for fresh rosters, this variant is an easy avoid.
