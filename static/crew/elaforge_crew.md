There’s an unwritten rule of thumb - if a crew can’t be 100% retrieved, they’re probably not useful enough to get excited about. That’s not totally true in Ed’s case, but it surely does point to his aging profile and what sort of value you can expect long term.

Before that tumble reaches terminal velocity, you should be able to squeeze some more voyaging out of him. Perhaps not a recommended journey starting from star one at this point, Ed nevertheless has a plus skill set, splash of everybody’s hardest stack in MED/CMD, and all four of his traits trigger anti-matter bonuses. 

With the totality of his post-voyage value tied to the Exobiology trait, there’s no shame in beholding a crew with a boring skill set if their long term benefits beat out adding early stars onto Ed.
