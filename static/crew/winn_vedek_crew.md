As a hated villain among the fanbase, you may want to ignore the impulse to airlock her immediately, because she does have SOME utility in the game. Her DIP Base might allow you to unlock a Node or two in Cadet Missions until you find some better options amongst her peers, but once you’ve finished, Frozen, and ideally forgotten her, she may delight you with up to three non-Rarity Collections one day.
