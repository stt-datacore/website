I'm notoriously tough on non-event 2-skillers which you know Pulaski is when freakin' Chakotay doubles her features. And while her MED lead over the former mega Bashir is significant, her tumble down the base ranks throughout 2019 is very, very concerning as those now besting her, including former mega Qod, are all competent voyagers to boot. Unless you're desperate for a MED base, it's advisable to seek Pulaski's peers who also offer more utility.
