Prospero, a 2017 crew, is certainly starting to look his age. Having missed out on the Holodeck Enthusiasts collection to his big brother Data V, Prospero has also seen his previously rare skill set expand and his voyage power continue to drop. But he still bears out as a mid-level behold choice thanks to his spot in one of the most valuable stat-boosting collections in the game and storied event history. It's almost all post-cryo value for Prospero, but it's a Legendary's world and we're just livin' in it.
