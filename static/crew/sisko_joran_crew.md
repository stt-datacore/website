During the events of “Facets”, Benjamin Sisko agreed to be inhabited by psychopathic murderer previous Dax host Joran Belar, and it’s this scene that provides the stirring art that accompanies this crew into the game as the recurring Legendary crew for the Trill mega. 

Even though this crew’s immediate Sisko variant predecessor “Sisko, The Emissary” is a stronger raw voyager in the same triplet, Joran Sisko has a superior skill order with a SEC/SCI top two pair.  SEC/SCI has long been a hard pair to staff properly in Star Trek Timelines, as there are only 5 crew as of the writing of this note with SEC/SCI or SCI/SEC as their top two pair in the top 100 voyagers, and Joran is atop that list.

To go along with a good skill set and good power (rated in the top 30 on release), Sisko has 5 antimatter seats he can fill.  On the trait topic, he only unboxes with 1 collection (Musician), but has 3 more traits that could easily be included on WRG’s monthly collection release schedule.

Sisko events seem to be evergreen, and with the #2 Sisko SEC, just points behind his High Roller variant, and the #2 variant SCI, barely trailing Benny Russell, he’ll find plenty of weekend work.  Plus, the #3 overall SEC base will give him non-bonus seating when you’re staffing requisition shuttles.

With WRG these days, you’re either “built for gauntlet/ship battles”, or you’re not.  Joran Sisko is not.  As recurring Legendaries go, he’s pretty valuable, so get yourself 4 copies and maybe add the 5th star if you’re feeling frisky!  Just don’t drop the forcefield or you’ll be sorry…
