There's a basement level of usefulness for Discovery crew and this is it. Events aside, the Fonzie card art is the best thing about Rejac. He's unlikely to contribute day to day without several stars and his event opportunities rest on something of a bubble at this point. Klingon and Disco have combined for huge swaths of bonuses already, but who can say how many more they'll trigger? A low ranked gauntlet pair with the occasional 65% crit might make him a rare fifth member of your gauntlet squad, but that's hardly worth spending a behold on.
