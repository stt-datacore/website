Medic's respectable voyage MED is paired with two trickier skill combos to give him 8+ hour staying power in the face of a sinking overall score. Boasting multiple Paris events in each calendar year, this particular variant has also struck big bonus feature gold four times, making his top overall MED base a high-impact skill. He's an all-star for the less represented MED skill and shrugs off a lower voyage rank with a skill order that only Warship EMA shares among legendary crew.
