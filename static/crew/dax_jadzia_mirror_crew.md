Behaving like a partially fused gold, this Jadzia has been an attractive prospect not just on the behold screen, but for building extra copies as an event piece. She still excels there, but Dax will likely never again reach her torrid weekend pace from 2017 and her voyage power has fallen off as well. The Mirror collection spot solidifies her as a top behold pick and her still-great SEC base fills a great niche for future Dax and trait events.
