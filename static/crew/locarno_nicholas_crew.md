Admiral Owen's prodigal son has been a punchline since his debut. Some thematically appropriate arena evasion is an option if you can swallow the accuracy handicap, but realistically he's a popsicle stick with traits attached. Keep an eye out for some more 'realistic' mega and collection possibilities like Pilot or Maverick to hit - if enough of them do, he may squeak into contention in low level beholds.
