Don't let Mrs. Gangster Spock's numbers fool you. On voyages, a SEC/SCI crew with a few stars will always pop up to at least within view, but with several better options available to you since the mid-2019 portal update, you might find that she's struggling to stay relevant. Even 4* crew like Fugitive Spock will probably manage to eke out in front of her unless you've really put the time and the citations in, to say nothing of if you've managed to snag an Away Team Burnham or someone marginally worse. In Gauntlet, she can still pitch in some ranked pairs, but outside of the edge of a few 45% trait sets, she'll probably be a rotational fifth rather than a cornerstone of your strategy.

On the plus side, the Blonde Borg Bombshell does offer a base SEC which, despite its seeming appalling rank, is still a variant best for Ms. of Nine, something to keep in mind since her event frequency has actually been fairly respectable, to say nothing of the inevitable ST: Picard events. That being said, if you snagged (go go!) Fenris Ranger Seven, she performs at 95% of Neuf's strength, without the need to star up such an expensive crew, so that value comes at a price. Rounding her out is arena accuracy at four seconds with healthy crit values that you might find useful, especially for Skirmishes. A more valuable crew than the poor numbers intimate.
