“Oh yeah, that’s right. Boimler’s the Borg Man!”

Sadly, those are the words of a C+ performance during Bradward’s Starfleet drilling. Babies be (not) damned, he can do better! And one way he improves is in his Timelines representation!

That’s right, this is by far the best Boimler variant to date by a(n Undiscovered) country mile (we don’t talk about He Who Must Not Be Named). Leaping out of the simulator with a certified BigBase™ SEC is impressive in a vacuum, though tempered by the fact that recent Mega Crew Joran Sisko pips him by one point and all but the newest players will have him. Thankfully he will have a chance to shine on Voyages with his eight(!) AM Seat traits and somewhat barren Triplet. Sadly, while he has Voyage traits up the wazoo, he only has a home in two Stat-Boosting Collections at the moment. Like the persistent Boims, you shouldn’t give up hope just yet though as he has a decent shot at picking up four more as future collections are added.

While B³ successfully battled his way out of a Borg encounter on screen, in game he is DOA when it comes to Gauntlet. He may help you put up a fight in FBB though thanks to an Evasion boosting 25% Hull Repair, coming online just a bit later than Tribble Herder Scotty and cycling just a little bit slower than King Ridley.

So, brush up on your chess skills, grab a glass of water, teach the Borg Queen some empathy, and pick up a copy of Borg Baby Boimler today!
