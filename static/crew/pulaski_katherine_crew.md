A fairly thin trait set and middling voyage rank may grab the eye, but MED crew play by different rules, even if there are more options now than there ever have been. Kathy remains a viable, if not amazing, MED voyager with good metrics for all permutations of her set and a sizable base with admittedly limited chances at a weekend bonus. Medics don't come around too frequently and though it's a shame to see Pulaski's skill set tied to an event corpse, she's still strong enough to catch weekend work while pitching in worthwhile voyage credentials.
