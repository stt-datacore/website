A skill set that used to be rarer, voyage power that used to be useful, and 'dual 1k bases' which used to headline. Now slumped in the stat rank doldrums, Zef's two benefits are a gorgeous, double-digit smörgåsbord of traits which have provided a respectable number of event chances while promising more down the line and triple stat-boosting collections

Not your typical base/voyage consideration crew, Face Fuzz Cochrane is still bound to pop up in shuttles when you least expect it and is a fine low-end behold choice if you want to make that trek through his stars.
