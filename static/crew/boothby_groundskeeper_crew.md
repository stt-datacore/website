A very rare combination of skills means Mr Boothby will be tending to your growing Voyages in no time. His stats on paper are not amazingly impressive but the combination of all three might just push your voyages to the four hour mark. Sadly no extra collections and no eligibility for cadet missions knock him down a few tiers. If you already have some of the stronger 3* MED crew you will probably have him sitting out of the way.
