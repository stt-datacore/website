The Fonzie card art is the best thing about Rejac. Strikingly similar to his brother in arms Tâ€™Kuvma, Rejac (rejac, Rejac, REJAC) is a part-time gauntleteer in the early game thanks to strong crit values, a shuttle stuffer thanks to the preponderance of CMD/SEC seats in events, and a collection piece. His trait footprint outstripes his brief role on screen, even making him a justifiable retrieval option for veteran players who only have eyes for collections.
