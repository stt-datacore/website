Solid voyage numbers are a bit more noticeable thanks to two event features where you can snag him fully fused, but his SCI base used to be a better option and will likely struggle to find a seat with increased competition from the likes of several Discovery crew. A "use" crew if you can star him up early, but risky long term benefits since he doesn’t get a cut of the Dominion event pie and needs his traits to trigger weekend work. A somewhat tricky node unlock gives him niche early game use - just don’t expect many thaws once you’ve starred him up and completed his fairly expensive build.
