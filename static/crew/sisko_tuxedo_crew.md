The skill set won’t look great on the behold screen, but like his tux, Sisko is one of the very best to wear it. The top SEC base with regular event work would be good enough for most cards, but he throws in suitable voyage power to go with it. Even if your Roller might have lost a bit of shuttle advantage from his previous inclusion as a campaign crew, SEC has more Faction event seats than any other skill and you’ll have no trouble plugging him in there, almost without exception. Trepidation about Roller’s common skill set is understandable, but he’s a legitimate citation target as one of the more powerful crew in the game.
