T’ana did it better. Sorry, but if you’re after a MED-led blue coat animated eccentric released in April, Tendi couldn’t even surpass the prototype. To be fair to her, the parts outperform the sum here; there’s reasonable voyage efficacy, a nice base, four collections…yet the sum is disappointing for a new release.

A hundred plus crew will have a better collection profile at any given time, her voyage power sits far outside of “Later, losers” territory and thus will drop ranks faster than some, and MED bases historically struggle to find event seating. So while she has several fine attributes once fully fused, none of them particularly reach elite status and in this rat race treadmill of a game, we’re advising you to toss your cites on cards who have outstanding attributes which have proven in other crew to stand the test of time.
