Not sure what WRG was trying to pull when they built him but he actually has some respectable numbers for someone beating the drum of DIP/SEC yet again. Your opinion of him might depend on how many stars you need. If it’s the first star be aware that the superior Quinn is available for free in the missions (remember to adwarp to get two) and that citing him up might not be worth the extra tier in the Western Collection. But he is strong enough to be a considerable voyager and his traits will grant him a seat on an intergalactic stagecoach.
Despite the lack of potential future variant events and a skill set that would get lost in the OK Corral one wouldn’t be remiss in giving credence to our good friend of the south here...oh no, I’ve gone all western too. Dag nabbit!
