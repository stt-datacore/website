Riley's not quite bottom barrel in any of her metrics and so that may inflate her overall rating, but you're really only ever getting value from her traits for post-cryo activities like events or stacking collection boosts. A strong trait lineup overall may have been pooh-poohed previously for trait pools too large to be considered, but in the midst of Timelines' collection era, nothing is to be taken for granted.

Her floor is multi-collection piece and her ceiling is a half dozen collections with a mega or two per year. Behold and level according to your roster needs, with her generally falling on the side of later-game pickup.
