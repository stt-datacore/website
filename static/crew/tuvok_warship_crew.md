Thanks to a slew of traits including two megas, Warship has hit twenty bonus events which gives him plenty of chances to anchor your shuttles or even sneak in a Galaxy crafting node here and there. His top 10 SEC rank may not be the catbird seat, but it's closer to #1 than it would be for any other skill and SEC is the most common Faction seat; a good place to sit his #1 Vulcan SEC. The last Dabo Wheel update gave players a couple more Position options to activate Tuvok as a damage option on ships. His ability comes online a hair slow, but still packs enough punch and is certainly thematic.
