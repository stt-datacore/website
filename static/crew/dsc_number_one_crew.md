They don't call her Bridge Officer for nothing - more than 18 months after her debut, Rebecca Romjin (like the lettuce, friends, like the lettuce) is still providing the bonafides day in, day out, on any voyage that cares to field her. Now that Strange New Worlds is a certainty rather than a dream, those who invest are sure to find they've bet on the right number, and even if she didn't have that pair of loaded dice up her sleeve, she's still an easy recommend for daily use.

DIP/ENG isn't as rare these days if you choose to cultivate it properly, and she's surrounded by options with different tertiaries or other ancillary benefits that can be tempting, but in the end, it comes down to who the Guardian of Forever chooses to barf in your direction. If she's who turns up, it'll take a whopper of a card to avoid being lured in by her voyage metrics, her base, and her alluring mystique. Just don't let the DIP/ENG Gauntler pair fool you - with Red Angel swooping down from on high, you'll find it a bit of no man's land trying to field rolls like these without courting disappointment.
