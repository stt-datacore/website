I just want to say - still salty about removing her Bajoran trait days before its first event bonus. Dick move, man.

Traits are indeed the name of the game for Seska who, despite an ENG-led skill set, has zero functionality for normal day to day operations. With Kazon and Obsidian Order traits not likely to bear fruit for collections or events, she’s more or less hanging on to three traits for value, but has a valid chance to hit her collection ceiling before too long.
