The rare reward for a mission in Episode 10 (don't forget to Ad Warp!), Quinn no longer offers any daily use due to age, but is an interesting study in Legendary Citation use. You could argue that the best time to have Fully Fused him was the day he was acquired, and the second best day is now, given that he’s finally coming into his own via Collection slots. Difficult spots in rather niche Writer and Q Continuum Collections make him an intriguing choice for a Citation target, and given he could top out at a total of four, you may want to consider plopping down three Legendary Cites on him and cashing in.
