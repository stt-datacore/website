Make way for Prince Bashir!
Say hey, it's Prince Bashir!

Hey! Clear the way in the Celestial Bazaar
Hey you, let us through
We’ll be adding stars
Oh, come be the first in your fleet to behold this guy
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums
Ride the collection high!

Prince Bashir, fabulous gear, worth an event thaw
With respect to the gauntlet
He’s guaranteed
To pair MED rolls with his COM
And like Doran say, “Salaam”
But feel free to skip his shipboard attack speed

Prince Bashir, he’s Engineered, kinda like Khan was
Strong as ten regular men and gentlemanly
He’s won collection awards
And stacks up VP rewards
Who boasts the best gauntlet scores?
Why, Prince Bashir!
