To Whom It May Concern, Mr. Natural here is something of a Tragedy. I Can't See Nobody like this doing much for any roster, aside from some token collection and event value. I know that Size Isn't Everything, but we're more than 2 Years On from his release with his only significant metric being event count. The only way he's Stayin' Alive is if he lives his Life In A Tin Can cryo. Children of the World can do a lot better with their Behold choices.
