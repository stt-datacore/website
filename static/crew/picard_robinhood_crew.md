Robin Hood has long had a reputation as big as his SEC base and in the right situations can live up to it. Offering no non-shuttle daily use, the more interesting point of focus is his trait list.

Mostly untapped for events and collections, a Simpsons handful of four traits could feasibly add a lot of value to an already useful Picard variant via mega after mega or a five collection ceiling some time down the line. While certainly deficient in some areas, there's strong baseline value here with realistic room for growth.
