Listen, if you had the hots for an artificial scientist and your overbearing sister was leaning just a little too close to your face for comfort, you would have some performance issues, too. It's hard to imagine what Narek can do for an experienced roster in this well established skill set, which contains every legendary Captain, Klingon and Q, even if he holds up in the upper echelons with enough DIP proficiency to nearly outclass some of the more uninspired two skillers in that field.

However, aside from a collection bonus and few useful traits, Narek brings nothing new to the table that the dozens of DIP/SEC/CMD 1/5 crew hanging around the lower decks of your crew quarters cannot provide, and they likely have better fringe utility, too. It's hard to say if a proper Picard event or Romulan mega will provide a decent use for him, but for now consider him a commonly strong entry in the DIP/CMD leagues, then pick someone else.
