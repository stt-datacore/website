WRG went with irony for Odona’s ship ability, blunting her instant damage with an evasion handicap and limit of two in order to mesh better with her chosen quote. Also decidedly mediocre for collections and events, instead turn to her voyage tab to find bankable value.

Odona redeems a pedestrian-for-MED Antimatter rate with strong debut power. Crew owning any amount of MED are generally in shorter supply than other skills and thus endure longer in the face of falling stat ranks. Her particular skill order only proffers two options in the top 200 voyage ranks, lending her further leash in that area. 

While Odona is a fine crew overall and worthy of, say, tapping over a weekend, she’s not the most stellar cash-gated Campaign option the game has seen.
