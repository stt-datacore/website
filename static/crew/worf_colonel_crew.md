Perhaps unintentionally, WRG has given us a tough choice - make a multi-day voyage trek to pick up Worf's Grandpa and drop a few purple cites, or take some mid-level or worse gold collection crew to five stars. Of course, those whose glass is half full might argue that now there's a better payoff for the nearly thirty voyage token investment.

No matter how you acquire this Worf (who is NOT a variant for events), his handful of collections and a fine base to pair with his eclectic trait set is a pretty worthwhile payoff for the cost of a few campaign citations as long as you don't mind passing up chrome dome Picard.
