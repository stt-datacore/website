Look, sweetheart, you're gunna want this fella. Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow. But soon...and for the rest of your life. Only a few crew can unlock a particular SEC/Investigator node and if you missed former mega Thrax, then Dix might be your best option. And while his voyage numbers and skill set are not helpful, nor is what he brings to the gauntlet and arena, he ticks two collection notches including the massive 100 threshold Costume Party.

While his event count is a nice perk, there are so many Picard versions floating around that his primary, SEC, comes in 8th among variants. His ongoing namesake television show should help out his weekend chances to sneak onto a fourth or requisition shuttle.
