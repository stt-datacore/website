Once eyed as a potential event queen, straddling Mirror (#2 CMD) and Discovery (#8), Philippa’s starry future has materialised about as smoothly as a Vulcan science officer named Sonak. 💥 With Georgiou’s show in a holding pattern and blanket Disco events seemingly at an end, she’s no longer quite the dead cert she was.

As it stands, you’re gambling on a very thin trait pool and pure star power to make her anything other than an irrelevance on your voyages or a victim of the death knell that goes a little like “+1 Mirror crew.” Superlative art, though. Depending on your aesthetic taste, she might well be worth taking on that basis alone.
