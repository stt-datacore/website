Even though the first inclination is to slot Mirror Doctor Culber immediately into tier 1 simply due to his stylish red leather Mirror Starfleet uniform, we are going to refrain (for now). Mirror Hugh enters Star Trek Timelines brandishing a phaser in an aggressive posture and also wields akimbo 1k bases of SEC and MED. While dual 1k bases may seem blase to the veteran Captain given the recent influx of top voyagers, the skills in which he has them are rarely paired up. Mirror Culber's voyage rank has sagged a little since debut, but his skill combination buoys his longevity on voyages and the voyage power in his triplet is nearly peerless.

It's unlikely you'd bring Culber to gauntlet even when his traits align for a 45% crit set due to his poor rolls.  His ship ability features an Accuracy handicap and it will not likely endear him to Skirmish and Arena use.

Show megas are long dead (and buried) and much of Culber's event history comes from the Discovery bonuses he would have enjoyed 2017-2019, but his traits seem to pick up events here and there (see Mirror Universe, Interrogator megas).  His 2021 event history was sparse, but we hope that 2022 and forward will pick up events for Culber at a greater clip.  

He adds +1 to an increasingly easy Physician collection, but more importantly is a top tier Mirror Universe collection crew.  His inclusion represents one less Fungal Entity May or Mirror Detmer you need to fuse up to complete the collection and God knows youâ€™d rather not cite those garbage Mirror golds or take them in begolds unless you can help it.  Potentially we could see Culber picking up an Interrogator collection sometime in the future, but Brutal seems a bit large to be viable, now that WRG has expressed their preference for "smaller", neater collections.
