If I had a dollar for every "solid" Data write-up I've done, I'd have V. Thank you, I'm here all week. Feel free to skim the other ENG primary Data notes if you want an idea of what you'll be getting in general, but this specific variant has a couple noteworthy attributes. His collection is not quite vanity and, if you're nuts about Janeway, is one of the few ways to obtain the Burleigh children's caretaker. More importantly, Data V owns the #1 SCI base for a character with a not insignificant event count.
