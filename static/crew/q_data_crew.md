A unique dual-eligibility crew, Data Q qualifies for both of those characters’ events. Going forward, that means that he’s a shuttle-worthy SCI base for both characters and has collected a hugemongous event tally to date.

His handful of stat-boosting collections also help to make him a behold priority even if you're not fussed with Faction events. With little of interest on the periphery, Data Q is a low end option for daily play, but a prime target for established rosters and should be costing you bundles of merits to thaw for Faction events down the line.
