“Gee gang, who could be behind all of this assimilation?

(*Removes mask*)

Doctor Agnes Jurati, from the Daystrom Institute?!”

Oh…you haven’t seen that episode yet? Don’t worry, we won’t spoil any more than WRG already has. Which is a shame, as sadly this crew offers little else besides her amazing art and a strong Super Rare CMD Base.

“Ruh roh, rut about her Rollections?!”

Right! She debuts with 5(!) Stat-Boosting Collections, just in time for The Great Expansioning:tm:. In fact, at the time of writing you literally can’t even complete the new highest tier of Cultural Impact without getting her from her Event first. Further proof that this is definitely a card collecting game, it’d be very remiss of you to not at least consider getting one copy as she’ll be an essential piece in upgrading your bonuses going forward. WRG would have gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for us meddling Elderly Players.
