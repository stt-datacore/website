We’re hoping the royalty check from his Apple Watch commercial clears, because Scotty won’t be finding much work on your roster. The one reason you’ll want him, however, at least carries through to the endgame - collections. None of his three are any walks in the park, so when you feel you have the trainers and chrons freed up, feel free to immortalize him somewhere in the midgame.
