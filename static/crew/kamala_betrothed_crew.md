A decent two star voyager with the artwork of a Legendary crew. This is stunning both for the artwork and for her usefulness. Her DIP base is only beaten by Tilly and Gaia Odo and she scores highly on the voyage ranks. Whilst many Rare cards will make her redundant her early game voyage use can't be ignored, especially on DIP/SCI voyage. On top of that she gets work on Tuesday and Thursday cadet missions. Sadly no extraneous collection bonuses but her ship ability is a nice upgrade with some damage too. Now where's my invite to the weddingâ€¦
