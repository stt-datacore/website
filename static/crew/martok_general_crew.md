There's some intermittent event usage here, but you're taking Martok because he's a one stop collection shop. Veteran players will gobble him up at the behold screen as a cure for their collection ills as his trait list is all thriller, no filler. Unfortunately, the only other attribute of note is his trio of big bonus event features - all having come in different events. His bases may be too poor to considering thawing if heâ€™s not a featured name.
