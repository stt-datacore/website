Old lady Langer is a near duplicate of a crew released just days earlier; UFP President Ra-ghoratreii. Go read his note if you want to know almost exactly what you're getting with this card. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a 50s doo-wop group with all the dipdipdipdipdipâ€¦ Her numbers are fine, but a total non-starter of a skill set means that she's not offering nearly as much over replacement value as a less common skill pairing would and she'll be replaced that much more easily in the future. You're getting almost zero utility from this card outside of an ironic collection at the end of the rainbow and even though we can expect some mega event action from her traits down the line, to date she's only nabbed one weekend bonus.

If you're a sucker for Cardassians, DS9, or any subset of Lang's character, then her base and voyage numbers are good enough to find work for you, but it's certainly fair for us to want more from our investments than a bland crew who will never venture outside the confines of an occasional shuttlecraft or DIP voyage.
