This Sisko has floated around the bottom tiers for a while, but WRG's landscape shift to focus on traits and collections should help him out going forward. Six viable traits (to varying degrees) and a great skill set for event shuttles are a juicy pairing for crew, especially older crew and 2-skill crew.

While there's obviously a ceiling on cards who have no voyage, gauntlet, or arena ability, Niners is already a name that established rosters should keep an eye out for and he has room to grow into his traits, both in the collection tab and for weekend bonuses.
