Cocky Doc is a mid-level event/collection crew who, unlike scores of crew ranked lower, has a shot at some daily use if you're a fresh roster and looking at a pretty nasty behold.

A trio of 45% gauntlets and usable DIP roll affords you a few chances to cosplay as KLAW, the Murderous Master of Sound and annihilate your enemies with Doc's powerful sonic vibrations. Beyond that, check his event and collection tabs to see what you can expect; it's not hard to picture Virtuoso as a four+ collection piece with occasional usability sometime in the future.
