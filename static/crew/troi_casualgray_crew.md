Another working card that will get a fair amount of use early on. One of the few crewmembers who can work all week long in the cadet challenges. Whilst she is the second best 1* diplomat, she beats out the best (Comm Officer Uhura) by having much more use in other areas. If it were a choice between the two Troi would win out. Sadly, one of the worst MED scores, no extra collection fulfillment and a lackluster ship ability bring her score down somewhat.
