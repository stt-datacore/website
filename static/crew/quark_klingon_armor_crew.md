Make no mistake, Klingon Quark is a toadstool, but he's a toadstool with five previous event features and two collections, including the lucrative Klingon tag. Owning a crazy build cost, Quark's leveling lowlights include 70 Klingon house crests and the highest chroniton cost of any super rare crew. You may not want to level him until right before another event feature or when you're on the precipice of one of his collection thresholds, but he's become an essential crew for min/maxers looking to stack skill boosts in the mid-to-late game.
