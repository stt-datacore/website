Stop smiling at me like that, you're creeping me out. New and improved Happy Annorax outdoes standard issue Annorax statistically, but that doesn't do much to escape his eventual fate as a non-event voyager with little else to speak of. His overall total and big SCI/ENG voyage pair are nice, even if it's on the common side, and his bases can certainly pitch in on non-bonus shuttles as needed. Get away from that, and it's zeroes all the way down the line for arena, events, gauntlet and collections.

There's still oomph in the numbers, but this Annorax is a lover, not a fighter, so if he ends up sitting on your bench for a while waiting on that Casual mega (Hi, Frasier!), he won't make much of a fuss.
