Commandant Reaction-Shot got something of a drubbing when she was first released - she seemed very much like a new cast from an old mould, a statistical refresh of crew like Mirror Reed. And to a degree, that’s still true, but when you look at her stacked up amongst the others, she does stand out amongst the pack. Not only does she still hold the #2 SEC/CMD shuttle pair, but she can pull the trigger on a no-frills-attached 400% damage burst at 8 seconds. 

No, she’s not quite as quick on the draw as her Mirror Universe compatriot Captain Killy, but in the era of auto-battles, the difference is minimal, and with the advent of the new Smoke and Mirrors collection, you can no longer afford to be stingy with which Mirror crew you turn your nose up at if you want the bonuses it affords in good time.

Yes, she may be as vanilla as they come, yet another Disco/Mirror SEC base to throw on the pile - but since you’re going to have to reach into the pile and pick at least some of them, she’s definitely one of the picks of the litter.
