Vic's arena ability says it all - The best is yet to come. Already snagging a more-than-vanity collection that rewards a great crew, he also has a mouth-watering list of traits as long as his holographic arm that should topple like dominos amidst WRG's push for collections.

There's not a whole lot else to work with here aside from the occasional event (standalone or mega) which may or may not see his mediocre bases thawed, but "real" use is superfluous for this type of crew, especially as a non-legendary.
