One of the most warm and empathetic ambassadors in Trek history, this Paris card surely deserves such a diplomatic bentâ€¦ "I'd rather spend a year in solitary confinement than listen to any of this." ... perhaps not. Regardless, this 'intransigent young man' is a fine pickup for daily and event work. Between double 1k bases and a lack of competition among variants, this would seem to be THE Paris to own for events. His primary is 400 points above everybody's favorite lizard food Mutated Paris and his event count is not only healthy, but also heavily skewed toward Factions which all but guarantees future weekend work at any star level.

His voyage capabilities aren't lacking either. His skill set is fairly rare (though DIP/CMD is not), so a splash of ENG will help him edge out competition from the CMD/DIP/SEC set and draws comparison to the Borg Queen. If she's been anchoring your runs for the past few years, Paris should come close to matching her star-for-star, even considering DIP's ubiquity. On ships, a chunk of crit bonus at six seconds is sure to catch the eye of Skirmishers and offers a bit of peripheral value, even if better options exist.
