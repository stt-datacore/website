Like other exclusive crew, there's a bit extra to unpack about Banjo Man. As a card, he still puts in plenty of work and is quite useful day to day. On voyages he has a plus value skill set to help compensate for a notable lack of anti-matter traits and still has gas in the tank, particularly in the notorious ENG/MED stack.

Then we come to the buried lede; gauntlet. His #1 ENG proficiency isn't just good, it's stupid good. The only usable gauntleteer to bring an ENG roll within a country mile of Caretaker's is fellow exclusive The Red Angel, with other names below him including a 1-skill crew and a super rare. That monster ENG roll gives him ownership of a handful of ranked gauntlet pairs as well as the top ENG/MED pair by a double digit margin. Suffice it to say, he's a banger. His biggest weaknesses are rarely exceeding 25% crit and Red Angel infringing on a few of his pairs, but with such a huge ENG and ENG/MED lead over the competition, your best option against any Caretaker walls is usually 50 merits.

A set of juicy, untapped collection traits seem likely to join his exclusive Gauntlet collection spot and may have you thinking twice about citing a few stars on him in the future. While the older gauntlet exclusive crew may not drop very often, Caretaker's relative lack of event work or dominant crit gauntlets curb the usefulness of a dupe and make waiting the wiser play if you have other projects to work on.
