This alliterative T'Pol is a very close comp to the more established Gladiator Spock, trading in a number of his bells and whistles for slightly better daily use metrics. And while she is a standout SEC option for a character that doesn't have many, the fact that she mostly closely compares to a three and a half year old crew is not ideal.

SEC/SCI is generally a good voyage pickup, T'Pol will get her share of event chances, and the Vulcan collection is a nice added benefit. Pernaia does well as an all-'rounder, just keep in mind that her weaker debut metrics significantly shortens her shelf life as an option for long-term investment.
