You gotta admit the hedgehog looks pretty snazzy in the security gold. An elite voyager on release, Tac Neelix isn't far off of that now, years later. SEC/MED has long been (and probably will always be) a precious resource on planet Voyage and helps keep Neelix among stellar company even without the strongest set of anti-matter traits available to him.

He'll want to hang onto that voyage ability for as long as possible considering Neelix is nothing resembling a household event name. Still, his SEC base ranks well among his various traits and variants and he's already a multi-collection offering with the possibility to add to that count. His utility is not terribly broad outside of voyages, but still crushes it in an important area of the game with some peripheral perks to proffer.
