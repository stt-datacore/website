For those that don’t have Tilly, there’s Odo. Second highest 2* DIP stat which will be incredibly handy until Shran or Florist Q drop from the portal. One of the best crewmembers to use on the alien cadet missions but sadly no extra collection bonuses. Like all Uncommon crew, useful until he’s not.
