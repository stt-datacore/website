As someone once said, this is what you're hoping for if they add your favorite crew to the game. The odds of Li Nalas being, say, the number one Voyager were about as likely as catching a Cardassian Gul unarmed and in his underwear. Showing his age, Li will probably parlay his quintet of Traits into an equal number of Collections one day and has already cashed in sixty percent of them, so feel free to snag copies of this “Navarch” (a made up title if there ever was one) from Legendary Beholds as they come.
