Even if you don't have fond mammaries of Phlox, you have to admit his body of work is impressive. The cupboard is no longer bare of ENG/MED crew and we can be more pec and choosy about who we thrust out there, butt he's still a member of a most attractive skill set. And while his SCI base no longer warrants a wolf whistle, it's still a thicc and formidable package when taken alongside his fringe benefits, such as his low-hanging gauntlet pair. P.P.S - don't let him slip through the crack if your voyages need some lift. Just don't focus on the fact that his shuttle and event contributions are so naked.
