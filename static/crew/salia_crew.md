Wesley might be Salia-vating over this shapeshifting Daledian but like her treacherous attendant we are not as impressed with her swooning over you solids, wait which shape shifting race was this again?

Her skill set is rare enough that one might gaps in the roster with her. She’s comparable with Runaway Po who scores better traits and power but the gap isn’t too distant. Her biggest asset is the +1 to the difficult Diplomat collection and any Super Rare card with this is worth hanging onto, however she won’t be featured in too many events going forward and Civilian and Romantic are her best voyaging traits. One I hope to dream of a voyage where her eyes are stars, and the universe worships the night.
