Maquis Tuvok might make the cut on a personal list of crew who deserve a power refresh, considering the dearth of great Tuvok golds and baffling lack of love for Tuvok events. A SEC primary is great for events and SEC/SCI is a fine stack to target to upgrade your voyages, but due to either a lack of power or opportunity, this Tuvok ain’t the guy to help you do that.

The clutch ingredient that could help spur his redemption arc, however, is a pretty quality list of traits. They’ve provided the bulk of this variant’s event chances as well as some collection value with just a third of them pitching in. Should the rest of his trait lineup awaken, his value could be on the upswing as a low end behold or retrieval option.
