Having aged out of non-shipboard daily use, M-113 will have to hit on a little more trait value to pay off her equip list of required items from five different factions and rare components out the wazoo.

Her first star offers fine starter-grade arena damage while an eclectic trait list promises varying amounts of collection and event potential. No one would blame you for passing on Salty if you're cruising through the mid-game, but there's a chance to see an uptick in value here if her traits align.
