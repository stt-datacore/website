Senator Vreenak is hovering over this guy's shoulder, but C.O.P. Founder is as Picard as all the rest. Because of that fact and his two 1k bases, his chances at work are looking up with his ongoing namesake show. Unfortunately, that's the limit of his utility outside of a vanity collection which often isn't reason enough to star up such a narrow crew.
