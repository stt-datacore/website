NS Tucker is a blend of interesting attributes and ineffective numbers. His vaguely top ten ENG and ENG/DIP rolls ultimately result in him being clowned on by The Red Angel, as most crew are. However, a Simpsons handful of 45% crit sets give him enough power to bring along occasionally and he is able to match the featured skill in three of the four instances.

Formerly a voyager (when we walked to school in the snow uphill both ways), Tucker shouldn't be used in that capacity any longer despite his myriad anti-matter traits. But because that skill set is generally low power overall, it's a good combo to keep tucked away in the back of your brain for future releases.

The last stop on this wagon train to the lower tiers is naturally the event/collection combo. Trip's bases are flat out bad, but he does get just enough event love from WRG and has a number of traits that could and should provide many more bonuses. Similarly, he's already a good collection value even if we ignore his vanity and a few traits waiting in the wings will keep him a buoyant, if not overall powerful behold option.
