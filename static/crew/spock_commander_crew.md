It’s Spock! Iconic character, decent common crew. Second best 1* science stat and gets the Vulcan collection filled out a bit more. His ship ability is pretty decent and when paired with a high attack card will make short work of some early game enemy ships. He has a nice amount of bonus traits sadly his command stats are pretty poor otherwise I’d have put him up a tier.
