Palmer's usability is fitting for her on screen role, but not the inspiring woman who played her. Anaemic traits more or less limit the lieutenant to daily shuttle pilot (#1 'ENG and SCI') outside of an Explorer mega - a trait that was on a previous survey, but perhaps not very likely. There's no gauntlet work in sight and a combination of low boost and slow-ish activation make her arena hull repair a tough pill to swallow as well. On the heels of our third ENG mega crew, this is a card best left to collectors.
