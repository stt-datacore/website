You know, I knew good ol' Dick Daystrom back in college. Guy was a whizz with numbers. Pulled a lot of tail, too. All-American halfback for the SpacePatriots...shifty sonuvabitch used to juke those android defenders right outta their moon boots. We rode him all the way to State finals. Sorry...where was I?

The venerable creator of the M-5 computer and namesake for the Daystrom Institute and award has a longer list of accomplishments in universe than he does in game, but at least has some wiggle room on his behold value.

His first star will net you a premier ENG/SCI bench warmer. Two superior crew in that stack exist as gauntlet exclusives and crowd him out to a huge extent, though a handful of 45% gauntlets (none of which feature SCI) will still be a boon to fresh rosters and allow you a chance to win with your favorites.

Traits are the rest of the story here as they give Daystrom multi-collection value and a shot at requisition shuttles once immortalized. Stars two through four are a big bullet to bite, but he's not a total dud of a card.
