Repent, sinner! Or the minister may perform an exorcism on you with his osmotic eels. Phlox has earned the admiration of players due to his uncommon skill set, but even though he still has value, he’s not the same vaunted name from 2018.

A skill set led by a relatively beefy MED/CMD stack is essentially the holy grail of voyage skill combos, but his overall power level is unavoidably meh-to-bad and he only owns two anti-matter traits. Those detractors severely curtail the chances of him voyaging outside of a few specific skill combos, yet with MED/CMD hurting for options, Phlox will make at least some kind of voyages longer than almost any other skill set of equivalent power.

His uncommon skill set also gives him a puncher’s chance in the gauntlet when his traits catch elevated crit. MED/CMD walls of overpowered crew simply don’t exist (yet) and Phlox will often be able to 2-for-1 a single CMD or MED roll from your opponents. Not a choice for established rosters, but a great early game pickup to help you break into a competitive area of the game.

With decidedly mediocre value elsewhere, Phlox has descended into the area of new player asset or precision MED/CMD voyage screwdriver. But if you need someone for your High School's production of Merry Poppins, Phlox is your man.
