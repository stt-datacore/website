Similar to his alter ego Chief O'Brien - let's call him Chief 2.0. He trades in a pricier build cost (3rd highest chron cost and 80-ish faction items) for better stats in every area. His voyage numbers are still very poor, but offers some of the best arena EV money can buy. Fast initialization, long duration, and heaps of accuracy and crit. And like the Chief, double collections and two events per year.
