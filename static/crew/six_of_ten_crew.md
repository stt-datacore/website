Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo. ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo. Fire streaks the heavens. Battle has begun.

You can bet your bloodwine I want the badass Korok at my back as we hack through fields of Borg limbs with our Mek’leths. And for a one off character, he does pretty well in game too.

Fitting the contemporary mold of Big Base, above average voyager, Korok also boasts strong collection value to set him apart. While that count isn’t likely to grow any time soon, five collections are plenty to give him the green light as an event reward or as a retrieval option once he hits the portal.

If you’re keeping contemporary with the game, you’ll appreciate that Korok’s skill set doesn’t conflict with any other Legendary Borg crew from his debut mega event, helping him to maximize the value of his Borg Antimatter trait. You can expect a voyage arc similar to the long time stalwart Assimilated Hawk.
