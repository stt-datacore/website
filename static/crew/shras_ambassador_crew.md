Owner of a huge DIP base, but with few events in which to multiply it. Despite those poor event chances and the most common skill set, heâ€™s still useful for newer players with shuttle-worthy DIP and +1 Diplomat for long term benefit. His +9 arena attack boost can meet or exceed what the more popular Rura Penthe Reed and Duras Sisters offer.
