Two skill MED options have it rough, rough, rough. MED is the skill that shines on voyages while being hamstrung by terrible shuttle seating. In this case, Linnis hasn’t gotten to do very much of either.

Despite a respectable trait count, Linnis has had several dud years with zero bonuses and her base certainly wouldn’t play on event shuttles without one. And with Ocampa unlikely to ever provide any value of note, her collection profile is average at best. New players could possibly utilize her in her 45% or 65% gauntlets, but if you’re forced into beholding her that early in your gameplay, you may as well torch the account and re-roll for a better RNG seed.
