This imposter Pi-card is well rounded, but with slipping power. A now-redundant skill set and weak bases are a problem for the typical aveunes of daily use, but his spot in a stat-boosting collection, usable arena accuracy, and Picard events with a dash of intriguing traits are enough to make him worth picking up for most players. A pair of 45% gauntlets is a nice asset for newer rosters, but can't hold up against the top shelf dice rollers.
