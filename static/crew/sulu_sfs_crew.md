It took nearly three years for Sulu to collect his first variant event and with numbers like his, it wasn't worth the wait. Despite enjoying a Pilot mega to close out 2018, his event future still looks bleak with traits best utilized by voyages and gauntlet. His top 20 DIP proficiency may have earned him a low ranked gauntlet pair, but he tops out as an early game contributor only for the majority of rosters. His instant damage in the arena is twice as slow as most cards and you can find better without too much trouble. Undercover Sulu has just enough tools to register as a radar blip from time to time, but is not adequate value for the cost of a legendary behold.
