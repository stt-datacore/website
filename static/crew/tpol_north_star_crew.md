One of the few ENT crew to get much love from WRG, T'Pol does well for herself in the realm of Events. A steady drip feed of variant bonuses interweave with several eligible Traits to provide North Star plenty of opportunities to show up to work with a big Shuttle score. 

Initial power on Voyages long gone, Fuse up T’Pol if you desire a quartet of Collections, Ancient West Vanity notwithstanding, and look for up to two more to come as time passes.
