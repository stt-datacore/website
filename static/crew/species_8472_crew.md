Bases strongly reminiscent of One, but thankfully a better card. His #2 SEC/SCI gauntlet pair is strong enough to hold off the coming wave of Armuses (Armi?) and his proficiency rolls are good enough to make him both the best gauntlet total for 2-skill crew and the #1 2-skill voyager. While his first star is obviously the most important, if you happen to stumble upon some stars for him in otherwise poor beholds, he can be a voyage player for one of the tougher skill combos. His highs are high, but he sports too many handicaps outside of his proficiencies to be worth a five behold investment.
