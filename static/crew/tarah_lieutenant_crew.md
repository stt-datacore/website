An arena attack boost at four seconds never gets a mention thanks to its accuracy handicap, leaving a reasonable SEC base and smattering of traits as the talking points.

Andorian is the eye-catching trait, accounting for most of her events and first collection, but she has a couple others which are in the bonus pool range for off-the-wall mega events and further late game stat boost hunting. If the Plakson faithful want her, you’re taking Tarah on the back of a gun and a prayer for a future mega to justify thawing her.
