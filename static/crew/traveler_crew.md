Wesley's creepy friend had a reasonable run as a top ENG option on release, but if you want to have anything to do with him now, go read his arena quote and then head on over to his trait list. Offering almost as many collections as he has fingers, that number should grow moving forward. Considering his  complete lack of other offerings, you may wish to wait until that count grows to four or five before you spend any behold or retrieval capital here.
