A fantasy crew in every sense of the word, this Timelines' Original is a late bloomer, picking up a few spots in some valuable collections to boost her status. Fusing vanity with stat-boosters, she's simply a mandatory crew for late game players, even earning occasional reprieve from cryostasis thanks to an inexplicable four prior event features. She's nothing resembling daily use crew, but a tantalizing mélange of collection flavors is totally worth the smattering of Terran Empire and KCA faction items needed to finish her.
