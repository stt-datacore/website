Seamus only asks for a shilling or two, but you're better off tossing a coin to your Witcher. The Story of Seamus begins and ends with an inflated event tally, but he sold his decent traits for another bottle of booze and sits in the long queue of crew waiting for a seat on a shuttle that may never come. Saints preserve us and send him on his way.
