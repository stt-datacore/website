Mirror Uhura unfortunately is among the set of crew that are so old and Bases so low you may not even retrieve them from Cryostasis when they get a Featured Event bonus, but at least she has a solid set of Traits that will likely  top her out at a quartet when all is said and done, which means she is a worthwhile long term investment from that perspective.
