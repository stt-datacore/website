When I first got here, I assumed the 6-pack was just a refined form of torture to make our prison stay that much more arduous. Gradually, I began to understand it more fully. It's all right here in my manifesto. My insights, my reasoning, my tiers. It's an experiment. They're studying us like animals. Pitting us against our wallets to find out what happens. You can see that, can't you?

Fittingly, Kim's 6-pack stayed true to its contents for many of us, exclaiming "This card is my friend. Nobody touches him!" But now that he’s in the portal and available for the low, low cost of 900 Quatloos, get bent Tuesday packs.

Kim’s base and gauntlet ranks seem ‘meh’ on the surface, but combine with a great skill set to make one of the most impressive voyagers in the game. Even as his overall power begins to dip and new releases shave certain skill combos off of his resume, his particular set of skills…skills he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for voyages like yours. If you let his daughter Tom go now, that'll be the end of it. He will not look for you, He will not pursue you. But if you don't…wait, what? Sorry, got sidetracked.


There’s a little on the periphery with a modest collection rating and early game gauntlet profile, but you’re looking primarily at a monster voyager now and beefy event history for additional long term value.
