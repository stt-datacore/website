Ah, the 2260s. A time of machismo, emotional constipation, tight red pants and conspicuously airbrushed abs that William Shatner must've slipped a WRG artist a lucky loonie to get past approval. Continuing the Big Book's patented line of Uberkampaign advice that can be broadly summarized as, ehhhhhhhhhh, Judoka Kirk shouldn't be lighting anyone's fire. While the fact that the nearest direct competition for this Skill set is Ushaan Archer may make him seem like a welcome refresh, that shouldn't confuse you into thinking he's actually good.

He debuts with so-so power in a time where WRG is printing much more desirable Skill sets almost every week in Events, Kirk has only a duo of Collections and just an overall lack of unique utility. Even as a Kirk SEC Base options, he's third-rate behind crew with much better art and areas where they shine, and while you can't really do wrong getting even the third choice Kirk, you can do better, surely? Especially when you're having to part with your hard earned doubloons. Even the addition of some missing Traits like the undeniable Counselor won't make this Shelbyville lemon leave any less of a sour taste in your mouth once the Campaign Track purchase clears.
