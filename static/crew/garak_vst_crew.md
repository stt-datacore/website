Joining the ranks of crew who are both seated and drinking a beverage, Hologram Garak comes to us via the Very Short Treks, and while some players surely are wondering when these cartoon crew will be over, this humble author would hope the answer to that question is “never!”. It’s always nice to have a new Garak enter the game, even in the Super Rare rarity, since he manages to check several boxes as to what a player might want from an Event Threshold Reward. Elderly players rejoice! Four Collections and room for two more is quite the coup, and the collection of Traits Garak has is a recipe for a few weekends of work per annum, even those his ENG Primary has never been in vogue for Shuttle seats.
