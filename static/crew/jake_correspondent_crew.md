Of all of the older event/collection combo crew, this is certainly one of them. Jake simultaneously has a poor and surprisingly high number of variant events, but you'll be counting on an uptick in his trait usage as well if you're considering taking a stab at this card. He does have a few traits that could add to his collection value and trigger a mega at the same time, but there are plenty of other cards that the same can be said about. 

Jake is not without a few avenues to a brighter future, but he'll need to avoid more than a few landmines to escape the 'Bees Jake' derision he usually garners.
