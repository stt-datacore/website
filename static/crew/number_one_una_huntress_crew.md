It's a good week in Timelines when you've gotten to write the notes of two back to back SEC/MED/SCI crew - the ISM mines are flourishing, shuttles are doing happy little loop-de-loops, nature is healing, and it's all thanks to the presence of good skill sets. There's also holiday cheer and New Year optimism and all that jazz, but who cares about that? We're here to talk about sapphic archers who stepped out of the voyage rankings into a truly awful six pack and made us all sigh in relief, well, thank god she's a purple so I don't have to worry about accidentally pulling too many copies of Lara or Dreamwalker Chakotay.

The second Elysian Kingdom crew to debut in six packs, WRG continues to fan the flames of a potential collection, but while Pollux Spock would be an all around banger even without that hypothetical carrot, Z'ymira is a bit more of a fringe proposition. For voyages, she's an absolute beast thanks to a heady mix of good power, killer skill set, and six for six on bonus antimatter traits, including the rare Hunter, but elsewhere, it's not quite a rosy. For those of you who have seen SNW season 1, you know that variants of Una are due to be retroactively added to a certain collection once the spoiler embargo has lifted, but even with that forecasted boost, she'll be sitting at two collections with four as potential - good if you like to gamble on WRG adding a collection for literally every trait, not so good if you prefer your instant gratification.

Outside of voyages and potential collection value, there's not much else here, with her admittedly hefty SEC base being somewhat wasted on a tenth tier event name like Una; outside of a sudden curveball resurgence thanks to Strange New Worlds, this isn't a crew you'll be fielding on shuttles too often, and she offers zip in Gauntlet and only slightly better on ships. Take my advice - don't do six packs, and if you do, just do three pulls maximum. And if you aren't going to take either of those pieces of advice, take this one; wait for cites to dribble in, don't pull for more copies. This is a crew that you can stand to work on slowly.
