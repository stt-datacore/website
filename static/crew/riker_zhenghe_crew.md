Even with good reason to be punitive toward the most common skill order in the game, Not-Captain Captain Riker brings enough power and just enough versatility to make him a worthwhile grab.

Sitting above the formerly formidable Kahless on voyages, Riker won't have as much leeway as he ages due to the abundance of CMD/SEC, but his Riker-ian anti-matter traits should catch him some stray seats even in the face of overloaded skill set ranks.

Despite a base sandwiched between Navaar and Helmsman Wyatt (what the fuck?), the Riker name has been an event mainstay, snagging multiple features in almost every calendar year. A common skill set works much better for shuttles than voyages, giving him ample opportunity to pitch in there and he does own a trio of traits that should play for future bonuses.

Aside from unrealized collection potential, Cap'n rounds out his contributions to your roster with a substantial amount of arena accuracy, in case you'd like to place Riker where he belongs - on your Bridge, kicking some treacherous Romulan ass.
