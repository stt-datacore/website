It's a fool's errand to guess future events (Pilot mega, really?), and there's no way to better illustrate how foolish it is than to tell you that this note used to mention just how good this Pickerd would look as the poster boy for a Romantic mega that never did, and likely never will, materialise. Oops.

In the here and now, Smitten is fine event crew with two shuttle-quality bases and an event count we can work with. Picard-mania swept through Timelines with a Happy Picard Day mailbox gift, a campaign "inspired by the recent Star Trek: Picard teaser", and a namesake television show which should only help his variants out on the weekend.

His spot in the Inspiring collection still has value and may be a behold tie-breaker as his star count rises. For a bit of added daily value, consider his arena damage at an ultra-rare nine seconds; slower than some, but fast enough to catch crew like T'kuvma sleeping.
