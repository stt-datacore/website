A Jonathan del Awesome character that for many long time Trek fans was one of the highlights of Picard’s first season. Hugh debuted as merely OK statistically, which doesn’t usually cut it after the laundry machine agitator of power creep has taken a crew through a few spin cycles, but there’s mid-level usage in a few areas.

Both Hugh’s skill set and Borg anti-matter trait don’t get a ton of love in terms of voyage power options, so he may see usage there for a while longer on your average roster, but won’t reach the heights of fellow Borg icons Hawk or Cheesecake. 

Well rounded to a respectable degree between collections, stray event bonuses, and even a few ‘screw it’ 45% gauntlets, Hugh falls right into the Retrieve for Fun *and* Money section of crew.
