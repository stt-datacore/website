As a resource with the hidden Historian Trait, here's as good a place as any to let players know that Chef Riker debuted in the never-before-seen 13-pack on a Tuesday. Would he still be worth dumpster diving a 13-pack to acquire? No. But don't read too much into that - no crew is worth that!

Two viable Traits put a hard ceiling on his value in both Events and Collections, but the Vanity Holodeck Enthusiasts collection has at least helped him out in that area and with a reliable Riker Event history to fall back on, Chef Riker will remain a mid-low level Behold option for years to come.
