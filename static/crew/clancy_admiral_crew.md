Sitting across my desk is a Wicked Realm Games employee giving me the pitch about a new Picard character. But she lacks the meme-able slogan attributed to her, her stats are a paltry reflection of her commanding prowess and the employee swaggers in with the balls and authority trying to sell me on this garbage idea?

Sheer...Fucking...Hubris

It was etched in stone that Clancy was going to own a common set due to her pencil pushing office role as a Starfleet Admiral, yet still she was done dirty. A strong CMD proficiency suggests gauntlet usage, but her miniscule DIP roll so laughably undercuts her ability there that Andy has already tossed his Clancy figurine under the bed alongside Buzz Lightyear and Gary Mitchell. 

Outside of her lone 45% gauntlet, there’s just no chance for Clancy to make a dent in anything. If you’re a new player eyeing her in a behold because you know the gauntlet can be a tough system to break into, you’d still probably be better served by taking a different crew competent in other areas and retrieving some gauntlet help instead.
