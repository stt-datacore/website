“The Army Tank with a Ferrari engine” is more like the legendary crew with super rare bases. Jazz Odo hasn’t hurt for consistent event bonuses, even with less help from his viable traits than one might have thought. Whether or not he makes a shuttle in those situations, however, will depend on his fusion level and the state of your roster.

Regardless, it’s value to be had at five stars along with an intriguing collection profile. The Holodeck Enthusiasts collection allows you to skip one of the aged legendary crew in order to acquire all five stars of Lucille Davenport, but Odo’s unique trait list may save him from the chopping block. With a high ceiling to his theoretical future collection value, he’s certainly not the worst dart throw to be found in otherwise low quality beholds.
