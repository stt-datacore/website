A repugnant combination of skill set and limp stat total makes him a non-starter on voyages, leaving events and collections as his paths to contributing on your roster. Plenty of variant events and two scoops of traits will activate Ben perhaps 2-4 weekends per year on your shuttles, but that's his upper limit.

The double collection hit being attached to a steady event name is a big help in the face of so many other terrible gold options. The value of those collections will fluctuate over time, but if he ends up being key for you in that area, there are worse crew to fuse than a series Captain.
