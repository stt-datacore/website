Gorgeous double collections headline this card...well, that and James Sloyan, but there's a bit more juice outside of those boundaries as well. Slow, cloak-triggered arena damage isn't really what we're looking to grab for our ship lineup, but it's at least an option and accompanies worthwhile base and voyage numbers, both of which are boosted by a SCI primary to avoid what could have been another paint by numbers CMD/DIP/SEC Klingon.
