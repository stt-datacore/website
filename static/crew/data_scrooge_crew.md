Data event chances, check. Main cast crew with decent stats, check. Fun themed holiday artwork to give some festive cheer to the game, check! I can't not smile at this card even with it's common skill combinations. For those in the premium leagues of the campaign, having 4/5 stars on any decent card is always a bonus, and you've undoubtedly made worse decisions than citing a card with his future potential for the upcoming Picard series to increase his use. Considering some of his better options require a 1500 event ranking, this card will absolutely get some work in the upcoming months.
