Joke crew generally don't fare well in game (Reginod #1 engineer, c'mon baby!), and 'Smell my Finger Linus' is no exception. This card pulled a big shocker to snag the only two realistic trait collections he could have and even then, who saw Resourceful coming?

Without healthy daily metrics or even average event chances for the future, this is a freeze and forget behold option for players who are simply looking to stack skill boosts from collection thresholds.
