Somehow Solbor has garnered double digit event bonuses from three somewhat diverse traits; I guess you CAN squeeze water from a stone. The craziest part is, he'll probably pop back up for a month down the line as the top Bajoran super rare DIP. Solbor is as freeze-and-forget as they come, but the 'collection era' may see Bajor's humble servant hit a value ceiling that we never knew he had when he debuted.
