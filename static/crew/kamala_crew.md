You kinda had to be there for Kamala. Her voyage power on release justified some daily usage, but with a very common skill set and lone anti-matter trait to fall back on, she won't perform up to her abilities in most cases.

With only a few potential collections in the hopper, this particular phoenix is more Last Stand than First Class. But if you’re particularly Taken, then who am I to deny love?
