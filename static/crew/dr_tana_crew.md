The first Lower Decks crew in game, and a MED/CMD option at that, has everyone all aflutter and declaring T’Ana the greatest thing ever. Luckily we’re here for a more objective viewpoint and, mostly, to rain on a few parades.

T’Ana is indeed a plus value ‘screwdriver’ crew for those tricky MED/CMD voyages. A near power refresh of fellow M.D. Pollard, this furrier version looks primed to voyage for just about every roster for years to come. The downside is a power level that’s merely competent for a new release. While she will voyage for a long time, she doesn’t offer the breadth of different skill combo voyages that a raw power option could and may not appear much outside of those one or two MED-centric combos within two years’ time.

It’s otherwise slim pickings for statistical highlights. T’Ana’s top ten MED base is hamstrung by the scarcity of MED seating and a fairly uneventable set of traits. It’s not outside the realm of possibility that her character receives many future variants and/or Lower Decks show megas, but until they come to fruition, we find it hard to recommend her shuttle abilities as much more than the cherry on top.

Her collection profile will remain below average thanks to that thin trait set and a unique two second arena activation doesn’t provide enough boost to be a difference maker in most cases. The dearth of MED/CMD gives the doc all of her statistical luster and also makes her a possible citation candidate, but don’t expect a do-it-all crew to kick off Lower Decks’ introduction to Timelines.
