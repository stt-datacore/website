Her big, fat Gauntlet MED roll is Crusher’s most noteworthy attribute. A couple of ranked Gauntlet pairs among all crew establishes her baseline power and can be absolutely deadly when she hits 65% Crit. Having probably peaked in the Collection tab as well, Doc comes with front-loaded value there and is a fine snag for late game players too. Crusher is never likely to blossom into an Event player, especially with repugnant Bases, but if Gauntlet luck be a lady, her name is Doc Crusher.
