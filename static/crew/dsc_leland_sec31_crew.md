Disco is Dead' may be a gut-wrenching, Academy Award winning film, but despite moving beyond those honied days of yesteryear, Leland still has something to give for many players.

Triggerless arena damage is a fantastic get as players dip their toe in the Admiral's division and into Skirmish, making Leland a great transition crew there (8 second initialization isn't useless [eww her ankles are fat 3/10 would not date]). His spot in the massive Resourceful collection is also a nice satchel of coins at the end of the rainbow. If you somehow still have him at 4/5 from his campaign years ago, it won't hurt to finsh him.

Somewhat underrated is his gauntlet ability. A trio of 45%+ sets including a dominant 65% set does a ton of heavy lifting for a fairly crowded skill set and, like his instant damage, is a great one-star boon to fresh rosters. While event work is essentially a mega-only long shot at this point, Leland has a handful of offerings to make him as well-rounded a crew as it gets for his common skill set and non-guaranteed event relevance.
