nIb'poH, Spiderman pointing meme, lazy dev work...whatever you want to call it, we have Doug Jones space Ent redux here with a near clone of Saru's previous 2020 gold version Vahar'ai. They're nearly identical with two key differences.

A voyage power refresh which is nice in the shorter term and will likely keep him afloat for an extra year or two over his variant contemporary. And a trait list augmented with a bit more substance than his counterpart. Aside from debuting as one of the better mirror options to immortalize, Saru should snag a few more collections if this crazy game of ours lasts long enough.
