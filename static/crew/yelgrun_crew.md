Iggy Pop! Yes, the Godfather of Punk is in Timelines, but alas, his card is nowhere near as top tier as his music. Yelgrun is one of dozens (hundreds) of crew who have minor event and collection potential that is slowly unraveled over years of gameplay. His one immediate, unique perk is an episode eight Dominion/DIP node unlock that only a few crew can handle.

Yelgrun isn't a must-have in the early-to-mid stages of gameplay, but his cheeky musician trait will help keep your lust for life burning long after heâ€™s shuffled off to the freezer.
