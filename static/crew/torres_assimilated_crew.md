Ignore her art's vomitous hue, that's simply the opposition green with envy as you move one step closer to finishing the Klingon kollection. Borg Torres is a stop and start event piece who's destined to see her event chances come in chunks thanks to a pretty plus trait set overall with variant weekends sprinkled in. Though her trio of collections are of varying value, she *does* have three of them and may see adjustments in value over time should any of them be expanded.
