A warm body for O’Brien’s modest but reliable event clip, this 1701 variant lacks any kind of daily use and you’re probably only considering him for his trait list.

The relative exclusivity of the Tribble collection means that this Miles will come across most players’ desks sooner or later and the formula for behold deliberation is clear - if he offers more collection and event value than the other crummy 2-skillers, take him.
