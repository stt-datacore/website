The latest action figure variant to kick off the TOS mega comes with some impressive base statistics. Recently seen sliding out of the top 10 SEC bases (that's how quickly things move around here), Uhura can certainly hold her own in a firefight, and with a healthy CMD modifier, she guarantees her place on most of your SEC/CMD voyages should you happen to get all the stars. She does, however, still sit in a large pile of many CMD/SEC/DIP variants no doubt attempting to squeeze into your roster like clowns in a convertible. Her event count suffers from a lack of Uhura based events and her ship ability is nothing to sing about. But if you are looking for a decent sharpshooter to boost a voyage up or hit those SEC shuttles then you can't go wrong with this card.
