Solid voyage crew stats for the girl who can see through walls. #9 MED base with reasonable SEC/DIP stats make her one of the strongest Rare voyagers in the roster. Additionally due to her alien nature she can work in all the weekend cadet missions. Nothing too special about her ship ability and no additional collection bonuses but her day to day use will exceed expectations.
