Repent, sinner! Or the minister may perform an exorcism on you with his osmotic eels. The first thing you should know about the Rev is that among legendary crew, only he, Dr. Pollard, Bridal Deanna Troi,Â and Captain Beverly Picard have MED and CMD as their top two skills. Which means that for certain voyage configurations, he's not just a great option, he's nigh the only option. Rev's WAR stat, or the difference in power between him and an average MED/CMD replacement, is monstrous and in most cases even better than ENG/MED crew and other rare combos.

A highly ranked voyage pair is generally enough to justify splashing some behold capital, but his offerings outside of voyages are still quality, if a step down. He boasts a top five gauntlet pair, THREE variant-best bases for a modest number of events, strong six second arena EV, and a good "MED and CMD" shuttle score. If you want to build a well-rounded roster, boost your weakest area, or need someone for your High School's production of Merry Poppins, Phlox is your man.
