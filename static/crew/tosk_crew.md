An eclectic Trait set is Groot's strength as it's already triggered a half dozen Event bonuses with room for more. Keep in mind that the sentence you just read has been this note's header since Tosk was introduced (so it's even more true now!), but WRG's tonal shift toward card collecting game should...should provide both Collection value and tie-in Mega or standalone Event bonuses as well.
