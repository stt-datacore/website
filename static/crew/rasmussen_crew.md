Max Headroom is an early-mid game performer with a usable SEC base and a SEC/SCI skill set for voyages that has a longer shelf life than most. Q3 2019 brought him his first trait mega, but with a primary base barely inside the top fifteen bonus crew, that's not the sort of payoff you'd expect for a pricier than average build cost.
