A strong #4 SCI base stat is probably all this crew is good for really. However the proficiency bonus falls short of other 3* crew falling to #11 Max. No cadet eligibility and a rather lackluster ship ability. Only keep if you are interested in getting some SCI nodes unlocked and the rare collection completed, otherwise move her on.
