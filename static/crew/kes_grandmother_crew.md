Yup, it’s unseasoned applesauce for everyone. Granny’s voyage skill set unquestionably looks great, but a super rare with a score ranked well into triple digits simply can’t keep pace with the scores of more powerful options, even if you have to attack certain combos one skill at a time. 

Yet that remains the highlight for a crew who is missing both power and utility. Kes is part of a shrinking group of crew who have yet to hit on a collection and though that seems inevitable to change, certain large and bland tags like Civilian or Desperate may not trigger for a while, if at all. Unless you collect three or four stars of Granny at once from a Kes event (of which there have been depressingly few), feel free to save yourself the crew slot until she offers tangible collection value.
