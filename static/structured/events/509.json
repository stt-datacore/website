Mirror counterparts and alternate versions of personnel seem to be taking each others' places at an alarming rate. But some possibilities are best left unexplored.","rules":"-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- In this event, Gold and Silver skills for Voyages will be SCI and ENG. \n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using any version of Marlena, Gem, Bashir, or Displaced crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the U.S.S. Reliant, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701, the Intrepid-Class Ship, or ships with the Ruthless trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Ruthless (Ship trait), Marlena, Gem, Bashir, Displaced","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_ve_aflickerofpossibility.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":29522,"symbol":"wesley_assimilated_crew","name":"Wesley","full_name":"Assimilated Wesley","flavor":"Anyone can fall under the influence of the Collective and lose their individuality.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_wesley_assimilated_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_wesley_assimilated_sm"},"rarity":5,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_wesley_assimilated_full"},"skills":{"security_skill":{"core":73,"range_min":22,"range_max":46},"command_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":17,"range_max":34},"science_skill":{"core":31,"range_min":17,"range_max":18}},"traits":["human","federation","starfleet","borg","prodigy","tactician","duelist","brutal"],"action":{"bonus_amount":6,"name":"Contact Established","symbol":"wesley_assimilated_action","cooldown":10,"initial_cooldown":6,"duration":6,"bonus_type":0,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":29522,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_wesley_assimilated_icon"},"ability":{"condition":4,"type":1,"amount":400,"arg1":0},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":29521,"symbol":"gem_crew","name":"Gem","full_name":"Gem","flavor":"Gem was kidnapped by the Vians.
