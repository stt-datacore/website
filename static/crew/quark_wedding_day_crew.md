They say that a rose smells as sweet by any other name. Well, this particular rose stinks, even with his new moniker. A nearly carbon copy of Klingon Quark, Wedding Day Quark hails from a fun episode, but brings none of that joy with him. With marginally better bases than his doppelganger, and roughly the same event eligibility, heâ€™ll bump your shuttle successes by a few percent and have plenty of chances to do so, but otherwise keep him out of the way as collection fodder, headlined by the 80-threshold Klingon.
