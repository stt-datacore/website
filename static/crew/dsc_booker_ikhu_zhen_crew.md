When it’s a Galaxy Event, and you can get 4 copies of a new Super Rare, it’s hard to argue not immortalizing that person right away...and this advice will be no different.  If you have the opportunity to obtain a 4/4 Ikhu Zhen Booker, go ahead and get your trainers and 2* Diplomatic Protocols ready.

Debuting at a strong Voyage rank of 28, but also the #2 DIP base among Super-Rare crew, Booker will find lots of use among early to mid-game rosters, along with our friends over at NightmareModeEnjoyers.com (editors note – this is not a real website...yet).  Booker also brings in 3 Stat-Boosting Collections right away, along with the possibility of 2 more later on down the long road.  You won’t be taking him to Gauntlet, and he won’t be battling in the Arena, but he is perfectly viable for a ‘free’ notch in your immortalization count.
