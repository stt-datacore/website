Finger Gun Palor Toff, as surely he will come to be known, arrives via one of the first sets of Tuesday Packs since the long dark times without.

He got a few minutes of screentime during “The Most Toys”, and in true DB/WRG fashion, he earns himself a Legendary crew card, released in a pack. What’s special about him? Not much!

Aggressively Average™ is thrown around pretty often these days and while it might be overdone, it sure applies here. CMD/DIP/SUCK also applies when the S in SUCK is SCI, and Palor Toff obliges by debuting in a bloated triplet (#11 at time of release), but at least has the good sense to be #2 in his skill order behind Recurring Mega Legendary Doopler Emissary.

No Gauntlet or Ship Abilities of note, and only two Collections at release, wipes some of the shine off his golden robes, but if you do decide to Follow the Traits and score a copy, you may see your patience rewarded with up to three more Collections in the recent future.
