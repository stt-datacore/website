Fighting out of the blue corner, with the biggest cadet SEC in the game... The Acoocha Moyer Himself! Chaaaaaaaakotay!

Chuckles is a compulsory immortalization for all players thanks to his collections, but that doesn't mean it should be done early on in your Timelines journey. The bloated CMD/DIP/SEC skill set, his slow, handicapped arena ability, and lack of any weekend cadet work all hamstring Chakotay in areas that matter for early game progress. And while the smattering of Maquis and Section 31 items needed to build him aren't too big an albatross, they serve to reinforce that he's not typically the best early-game return on investment out there.
