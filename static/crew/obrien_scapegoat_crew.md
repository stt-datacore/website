🐐 O'Brien's inclusion as a vanity Collection reward immediately introduces him as one of the more fascinating case studies of value and cost-effectiveness in the game. His statistical power does make the Collection a worthwhile investment in general (and should for some time), it's just a matter of when you should prioritize doing so. With three prerequisite Legendary crew you must immortalize before the machine spits out your candy treat, not to mention all of them sporting the same tired skill set and decrepit Voyage power, O'Brien's value should be tempered across the total numbers of stars needed to obtain and then fuse him. A set of calculations best left for spaces larger than this one. 

As a standalone card, he still has strong Voyage prowess which easily headlines his contributions. A plus skill set, and six Anti-matter seats still give him staying power two years after his debut, but Power Creep comes for them all, and it has come for the Goat.

Not a one-hit wonder, Miles also parlays a big DIP base into not only the top DIP/SEC pair on Shuttles, but a base for Events that nearly doubles O'Brien's previous best DIP option; the fugly Klingon O'Brien. 
Unfortunately as the Goat’s Voyage power continues to wane, he does not have the meaty Trait set to give him lasting value, since he’s already maxed out at two Collections which in today’s game is sub-par.
