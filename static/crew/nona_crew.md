For years, Nona’s arena quote said it all, but WRG’s collection bonanza may begin her path to redemption. 

Head-scratchingly short on power, even for a character from a cheesy TOS episode, Nona won’t play for voyages or gauntlet, even with the vaunted MED/CMD stack and pair of 45% crit trait sets. Outside of a dodgy event history punctuated by mega events which never offer more than two factions in a month, Nona really is just a collection dice roll past the early game.

The Caregiver collection pierced the foil on this terrible vintage crew and with a handful of untapped traits, Nona’s value should rise over time - it certainly can’t get much lower.
