Newer players should jump at the chance to grab stars on a crew in T’Pol who boasts robust base and voyage metrics and can expect her to be one of the later super rares replaced as their roster transitions to the Gold Zone. Even her arena attack boost can be formidable if you don’t mind being pigeon-holed into certain ships that can meet her trigger requirements.

Elderly players will be salivating too. Not just because it’s applesauce day in the retirement home, but because T’Pol’s heady trait list gives her one of the better collection and event profiles in the game. Pre-loaded with a serious tally in both areas, there’s no reason to believe those numbers will suddenly halt their inevitable tick upwards and help put her in rarefied air as far as long term value options go. If T’Pol is on the Tongo board; Acquire, Acquire, Acquire!
