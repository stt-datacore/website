I bet you were expecting a ton of Indian cuisine jokes in this note, weren't you? Well, there'll be Nhan of that Nhansense here, this is a professional endeavour, written by professionals.

Hailing from a mega that was half-Disco, half-Picard, no show bonus, Nhan is a textbook example of an ongoing source of uncertainty we've been dealing with at the Big Book - namely, what kind of boundaries we might be looking at for Disco megas going forward. Will they be main cast only? What about the bridge crew? Would someone like Lorca qualify? And Nhan, who, like all Disco crew, inherits a prodigious event count, highlights what a large chunk of value a lot of cards stand to lose if they don't make the cut from this point forward.

If she makes the cut, then you're looking at a shuttle hoss with prodigious bases, capable of slotting into a number of common seats and passing for a serviceable voyager. That goes double if you weren't able to snag any of the ENG/SEC options that have recently floated on by.

If she doesn't make that cut, well, your SEC/ENG daily shuttles will definitely see some improvement. But putrid traits imply that you may never see her in an event again unless you're digging deep in the drawer for warm bodies to fill requisition shuttles. As it is, we'll simply have to wait and see, so tikka seat and hope for vindaloo-cation.
