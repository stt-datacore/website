Keevan is almost an exact copy of Jazz Musician Riker but with a few tradeoffs. Keevan has a slightly higher CMD base but his proficiency is much lower. His ship ability will grant more evasion at the cost of attack but he has some use on the Sunday cadet missions whereas Riker doesn’t. I think the state of your game will decide which to keep and which to move on. If you need those cadets completed then Keevan is the better choice but if you are struggling to do damage in ship battles then Riker is the answer. Or just chuck them both a find Klingon Dukat...oh he will also need a lot of Dominion items…
