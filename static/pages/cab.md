title: CAB STT Power Ratings
---

DataCore now shows STT Power Ratings sourced from the [CAB STT Power Ratings website](https://cabtools.app/) maintained by *A Traveling Man*.

CAB Power Ratings are a system designed to help rank crew by their overall value, taking into account factors including their voyage power, potential event usage, gauntlet power, collections, and more. You can find a detailed description of how the CAB STT Overall Power Rating is calculated at [the Power Ratings website](https://cabtools.app/about-the-system/).

DataCore shows both the "overall power rating", which is a decimal number, and the "overall rank", which tells you how a crew's overall power rating compares to other crew of the same rarity.

DataCore has added this information to give players more ways to sort and evaluate crew. Like all ranks and ratings, CAB power ratings should only be considered a guide or tool - how valuable a crew is to a player depends on how much the player values different aspects of the game, and which crew a player already owns.
