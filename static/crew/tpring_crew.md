Nothing like a bad romance to evoke both the brutal and romantic traits from a crew. It’s been Vulcan-or-bust for T’Pring’s event work whose base rank has predictably sunk like a stone in that always competitive DIP skill. Clearly she’ll have no trouble finding a seat when bonus, but it’s probably best to not count on them and be pleasantly surprised when they do hit.

Elsewhere this heartbreaker looks to recoup value by converting her traits into collections, hopefully at a more brisk pace than her first few years in game. Aye, she’s got a B I G B A S E, but take it from someone who knows; after a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but is often true.
