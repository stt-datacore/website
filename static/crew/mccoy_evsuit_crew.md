The first of the ultra patriotic TOS red, white, and blue EV suits in game (or the more proper order of blue, white, and red for Picard's sensibilities), that would seem to be the most original offering that McCoy has for us this time around.

Offering a stable, beefy event history, you can certainly thaw EV Suit a few times yearly, but established rosters are also swimming in McCoy MED and with event seating skewed so heavily toward CMD, DIP, and SEC, he may not have room to ride one hundred percent of the time.

Coupled with his front-loaded collections, however, EV Suit paints a rosy picture for long term value. McCoy is one Desperate collection away from a Yahtzee and so he’ll be an easy behold pick for players who don’t use super rares on a daily basis.

If you do, McCoy’s not the droid you’re looking for. Ranging from bad to useless on ships, voyages, and in the gauntlet, the assets McCoy brings to the table are best left for later on in your Timelines journey if acquiring him comes at the cost of an early game-oriented option. We like him for vets, even if he’s not the best crew to get you there.
