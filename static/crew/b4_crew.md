Before (whoa, did I just uncover some unintentional wordplay from the cinematic masterpiece Nemesis?) wowed as a voyager on release, but with next to no utility outside of that attribute, his value as a card is paying for it now. 

His power and/or usability lags behind the pack in every other metric and lacking any variant events from other Brent Spiner characters leaves his weekend prospects completely deactivated. I’m assuming you don’t mind fourth wall breaks if you’re reading this far - B-4 is the kind of crew who makes us take a second look at tier weights so that players who select him in beholds know exactly what they’re getting into. He’s a fine early game voyager if you can acquire multiple stars at once, otherwise his value ceiling is extremely limited.
