To borrow an expression, why does this crew need to be? We'll get to her standalone merits in a moment, but as a Burnham variant, she brings nothing to the table that can't be obtained in better amounts elsewhere.

Debuting as the third best CMD base for Burnham's dependable event history, her strong overall ranking is somewhat muted by being tethered to a character which covers that skill quite well on shuttles already. And the CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set makes Cap'n Burnham victim number 200-something, neutering an already mediocre power level for a new crew release.

That being said, there is readily apparent value in a crew who gets the Burnham spotlight and owns a strong base and worthwhile collection spot. She will earn shuttle work (and some short-lived voyage fill-ins), just be aware that those may be secondary benefits for a character that you just like - there are more useful options out there if you're looking purely at gameplay potential.
