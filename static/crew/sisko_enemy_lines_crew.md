It's alright that Sisko's voyage power isn't there anymore, his skill set isn't one that you need more of in that area of the game anyways. B.A. Sisko is instead one of the stronger event/collection pairings with a valuable arena ability to boot.

His Skirmish and Arena nuke hits for the maximum amount among triggerless legendary options and is a fine substitute if you're missing one of the top shelf options - you won't miss saving a split second over a small number of battles.

A generous number of non-HFS traits have hit on multiple event bonuses and collections to date and may have a lot more left in the tank depending on how far WRG leans into the 'trait era'. Thisko Sisko may not be a daily use option outside of the arena, but offers about as much value as you can expect from a several years old card.
