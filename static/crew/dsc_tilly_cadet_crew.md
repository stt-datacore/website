Much like her engineering, a lot of Tilly's value is largely theoretical - thanks to the distorting effect of Discovery megas, a positive looking event count hides the fact that in the lifetime of the game, Tilly has only had two variant events, and while a TOS-style shift to bridge crew only bonuses would keep her from sliding into complete obscurity, there's just not a whole lot here.

What was once the #1 Disco ENG base has slid to #5, a once respectable SCI base no longer even makes the first Datacore page of Disco crew, and her traits are as barren as Regula I. If you're taking her in a begold, make sure that it's either for love or because the other options are truly diabolical, because this is as light on versatility as you can really get.
