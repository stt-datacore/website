The Best Kellerun in the game, we’re giving bonus Big Book Bucks to anyone who can tell us what episode in which his species was first shown. That being said, Rayner joins us via an Endurance Objective Event hot on the heels of Harry Mudd, and it’s hard to live up to the hype. It’s like playing shortstop for the Yankees after Derek Jeter retires. 

Ok, so you get four copies of this crew after completing a few in-game tasks, now what? Is he worth the Legendary Citation? Four Collections is nothing to sneeze at for this alien with non-Vulcan but nonhuman ears, and a Trait list that has room for one or two more. Yes, he’s got the dreaded CMD/DIP/SUCK Skill set, and deservedly so it is much-maligned in the cycles of those who discuss Skill sets and orders. Does he have the Voyage power to compensate? As Liam Shaw would say, “No.”. Do you need a Position Trigger-locked Instant Damage Ship Ability? Sure, maybe. It’s got a decent Attack Boost, it’s got no Limit on uses, and it could couple up real nice with the Constellation for Fleet Boss Battles if you don’t have Chances Taken Kirk or don’t have a maxed out Artifact.
