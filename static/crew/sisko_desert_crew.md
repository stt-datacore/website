A quick glance at his stats don't inspire confidence - the bases look poor and the proficiencies average. But Crazy Benji is better than he looks once you dig down a bit. 

Ben's Gauntlet ability is situational and highly dependent on his tertiary MED. Though he never pierces above 25% crit, he hits that mark often enough and with few dedicated CMD/MED Gauntleteers out there, he'll often outperform what the ranks would indicate, at least for that pair. 

Traits powering his Event and Collection chances have been more miss than hit so far, but with a foundation of Sisko variant events and the looming hope of a Pointing Collection, there's enough value strewn about for different players to try and utilize. 

The CMD/MED pairing in his skill set is rare, but unfortunately it’s Primary and Tertiary, and without enough power to get him on your Voyages. Desert is a long term play to accumulate stars slowly.
