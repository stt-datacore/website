Gardener, Kelpien, Spiritual. That's all the allowance Siranna has to make an impact, unless you're banking on a heroic return to Discovery megas. No longer viable in any daily use area relative to the field, the only light at the end of the tunnel seems to be Spiritual and/or Gardener collections and events.
