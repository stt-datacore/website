We knew eventually this would happen - Voyage Exclusive Legendary Loot Table Dilution! #blameTPG

Ok, ok… but it’s Grady from DS9 “Past Tense”, in what can only be the second harbinger of the Clint Howard Vanity Collection after Balok himself. At least if you’re going to make it harder to get Admiral Black, you may as well introduce a Top 20 Voyager with a plus Skill set. Yes, his Primary/Secondary stack is SEC/DIP but that is the best permutation of CMD/DIP/SEC and the ENG Tertiary is pretty sweet. 

Frontloaded with a trio of Collections and Traits enough for two or three more hidden somewhere in his jacket pockets, his long-term value is somewhat better than “dim”. If you get lucky enough to get a Behold on your Voyage and you already have Admiral Black, it might be a tough decision between him and Chapel, but Beltran Stans notwithstanding, he’s a solid choice for instant Citation.
