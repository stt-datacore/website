Sarah Sisko is one of those “she Voyaged for me for years” crew that has lost all their luster and now must rely on Event and Collections for enduring value. Former top tier Voyage power has melted away and her Trait list, while thin, is sixty percent viable, with three hits so far and two unstarters. Her decent Primary Base is well-suited for Event Shuttles if one of her Traits provides a bonus.
