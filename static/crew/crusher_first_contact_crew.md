With Physician so easily completed that it's liable to be the first collection you max out and Crusher events keeping pace with the oncoming heat death of the universe (three thus far), Dr. Crusher is a direct challenge to the oft-held maxim, "Because MED."

With numbers this bad and prospects this bleak, even with an uncommon MED/CMD stack, it's a struggle to recommend her over anyone but the even more dire of crew (they do exist, believe it or not). You had best hope you get all four copies from an event so you can equip her and freeze her quick, because hoarding copies through beholds for a reward this dire is the opposite of fun.
