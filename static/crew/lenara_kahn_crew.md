Kahn (no relation) is in trouble. With one of her three traits already tapped for mega action and another one likely too large to be called upon, Lenara is little more than a naked base. The first non-Dax Trill may signal an expansion of that subset of characters (Odan, oh boy!), or it may be a blip on the radar. With only a hair slow arena ability to offer on the periphery, she's at the mercy of a painfully thin trait set to give her periods of relevance. If you're here to see if she's worth the campaign investment, then the answer should be obvious.
