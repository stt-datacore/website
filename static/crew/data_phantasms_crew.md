Psst – hey kids – come here – do you want some free candy? And by candy, I mean Legendary Data?

What’s your favorite Data we have not seen in game yet? Something iconic, something meme worthy? Considering the theme of the month, something spooky? Oh, you’ve seen the episode “Phantasms”? Then yes my friend, you know *exactly* which Data we’re getting!

Call a friend, that’s right, it’s …..not Telephone Data. But he’s still from the episode and that’s the thought that counts? And he’s a give-a-way, so that’s nice?

Debuting at a top 30 Voyage score with great power and best-in-Triplet seating, Data will find Voyage and Event use on any roster for quite a long time. Sure, he comes with only two Collections up front, with Prisoner and Cyberneticist backloaded for the future, but his value is in being Data and giving use to any roster, new to elderly, VIP0 to VIP “Yes I enjoy Tuesday Mixed Beholds”. 

Now give this man a hand!
