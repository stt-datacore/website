His time in the sun came and went during the Dominion mega (#4 Dominion CMD, if you want to know), but if you didn't have him, then you weren't missing much. The #26 base CMD and a voyage total that just barely scrapes in the top 100 make this cookie cutter crew more of a hassle than he's really worth. Depending on your luck with Dilemmas, his +1 Diplomat might be handy, but that's about all he's going to bring you in the long run.
