It's alright that Sisko's voyage power isn't there anymore, his skill set isn't one that you need more of in that area of the game anyways. B.A. Sisko is instead a worthwhile, if aged, event/collection pairing with a valuable arena ability to boot. His triggerless Skirmish and Arena nuke hits for a hefty amount and is a fine substitute if you're missing one of the top shelf options - you won't miss saving a split second over a small number of battles.

A generous number of non-HFS traits have hit on multiple event bonuses and collections to date and may have a lot more left in the tank depending on how far WRG leans into the 'trait era'. Sisko may not be a daily use option outside of the arena, but offers about as much value as you can expect from a crew his age.
