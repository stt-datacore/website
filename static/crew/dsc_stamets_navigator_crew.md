Some Tennyson seems appropriate - "Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will..."

"Used to be good" is an all too familiar refrain for crew who relied on their voyage prowess for relevance. In this case, strike two and three was the 'Et tu, Disco?' backstabbing of that massive event bubble bursting. Now Stamets will be looking anywhere for a shot in the arm (sorry), which might only come from his two 'viable' traits; Explorer and Pilot. 

His floor is as a once-a-year event name with nothing else, while his ceiling would seem to be a two collection crew with perhaps a mega or two left up his sleeves. I mean, if he had any sleeves.
