Capitalizing on the popularity of newly-introduced Lower Decks character T’Lyn, TPG inserted her into a Tuesday Time Portal Pack (don’t pull 6 packs, kids!) but at least on debut she might have been worth your Dilithium. Notedly with a Skill set that is not CMD/DIP/SCI or CMD/DIP/SEC, she has “Later Losers” power on your Voyages and a Skill set to make good use of it. Another point of interest is her Ship Ability; a quickly Activating chunk of Accuracy and Crit Bonus for use on your Skirmish and Arena builds. Four Collections round out her value, so it’s likely when she hits the Time Portal she’ll still be under consideration for Crew Retrieval.
