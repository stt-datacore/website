WRG’s “The Year of Power Creep” (2022) has devastated formerly voyage-viable crew like Governor Worf and made them redundant like David Brent.  At least his art is still good!

Guv's big CMD score is more than suitable for daily shuttles and though he doesn't have many eventable traits to prop up his bonus count, Worf + Klingon is far better than most crew get and he remains the top Worf CMD base even ahead of Honor Hall brother Kal’Hyah.  His only other peripheral perk is a hardy +11 arena attack that comes online quickly enough if you can meet the Position trigger requirement and helps round out a crew who's about as valuable as it gets for his skill set.  His traits are a bit lacking and only one current collection is baked in, but he could find two more likely inclusions in the coming years with Duelist and Tactician.
