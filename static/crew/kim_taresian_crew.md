When your character washes up on the beach in an RPG and you grab a rusty pipe to go fight some crabs.

There are three points of interest here: arena evasion for the early game, fairly consistent events to highlight mediocre bases, and a few non-HFS traits that might hit the collection lotto at some point down the line. As of this writing he's one of the easier super rares to ignore, but has a path to value should his traits become featured material in the future.
