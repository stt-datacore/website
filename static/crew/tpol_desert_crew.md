The bulk of T’Pol’s value will come from voyages and she ranks quite well there, holding on to the best SEC/SCI voyage score, beating out former #1 Fugitive Spock by a fairly significant margin. In a skill combo that is always difficult to fill adequately, that sort of voyage accolade is useful, even for super rares. T’Pol also has a solid event count, and brings a variant-best SEC base to her weekends on duty, which means she ought to find a shuttle seat more often than not, even if her bases tend toward good-not-great.
