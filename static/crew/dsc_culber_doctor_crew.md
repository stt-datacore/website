The standard bearer for Disco excellence, Culber's stats read like a crew released a few months from now, despite being two and a half years old. He almost pulls off the Mirror Phlox for voyages by beating out the voyage score of a few 3-skill crew, but despite some excellent voyage metrics, the lack of a third skill does hurt when making long runs and caps his value there to situational-at-best. 

Nevertheless, we're after his big ol' bases. Disco dominance has been his calling card since his debut and it's safe to assume that his screen time would keep the Culber name safe if Discovery megas were to switch to bridge-crew-only. In conjunction with with a hint of arena value, Culber remains a versatile and powerful 2-skill crew among the very best, despite additions to the Discovery and MED/SCI scenes.
