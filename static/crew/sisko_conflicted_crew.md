Players conflicted about whether or not to acquire this crew better be facing some poor options next to Ben. If the cost of two middling gauntlet pairs is a pair of horrible bases, then that's a price I can't live with. With High Roller Sisko dominating the event competition and even two other variants above his SEC primary, Conflicted Sisko can't seem to decide where he wants to contribute. An ENG tertiary will help soften the descent of his voyage power, but this is more or less a character-driven card whose statistical relevance is the result of natural power creep.
