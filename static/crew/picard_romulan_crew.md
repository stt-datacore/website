A #2 base for a character with Picard's infinity versions is impressive. And we always welcome a racial trait tacked onto main cast to inflate their event count. In the gauntlet, his proficiencies put him within half a percent of the #3 SEC/DIP pair and can be formidable when he hits 45% crit. Some durable arena EV activates fast enough to avoid most instant damage crew and rounds him out well. The skill set is a bummer, but he's an otherwise versatile crew.
