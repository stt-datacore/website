A variety of traits help suppliment O'Brien's otherwise lacklustre event pace, but this variant is more of a collection box anyway. Klingon is the headliner, making him an essential crew to immortalize for late game stat boost collectors and his other two are both in line for an expansion with neither requiring a legendary crew to complete.

The rest of this meek Klingon is more early game-friendly with some situationally useful, short initialization +Acc/shield repair in the arena and bases which will catch the occasional bonus, but are likely to be edged out on more established rosters.
