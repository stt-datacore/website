TNG: “Descent” gave us Acting Captain Crusher (still waiting on that card), The One, Lore (sometimes we wish we didn’t have that decrepit variant), and now… CROSIS!

There weren’t a lot of named Borg from TNG, but now we have three of them, including Hugh and Locutus.  New Borg incursions into the game are few and far between lately - notedly only four new crew with the trait in the last twelve months, and there are a lot of very old Borg crew who you might not want to waste citations, behold selections, or Crew Retrievals on.  Crosis… may or may not be that Borg to break that streak.

He comes into the game on the lower end of voyage power for recent Legendary crew, and while his trait list is sparse, it does include his racial trait for a solo collection out of the box, and four more possible collections to come.  Yes, we are discounting Desperate, sorry.  What is nice however is that all six of his traits are voyage antimatter seats, and he’s among the top options for all of them.  Crosis is also atop his skill order over prior UberKampaign™ reward Judoka Kirk and there’s a lot of crap below those two.  Considering his triplet, he’s solidly top five with such luminaries as EV Suit Youhura, Barge of the Dead Torres, Ryn, and the GOAT himself, Scapegoat O’Brien.

A big SEC base will pitch in on weekends if you FF Crosis, or if one of his traits get called as a non-variant trait bonus.  He’s also got an interesting ship ability if you’re without Demo Man Scotty: +15000 Crit Bonus with a decently quick cycle time and a Boarding trigger.  Maybe he could find work in Fleet Boss Battles on a ship with Boarding like The Artifact?
So this all adds up to… an ok crew.  Get some Crosis… or don’t?
