The best 4* Spock by a country mile, and that would be even without his added event potential as a Discovery variant - a stellar SCI base, and a lovely SCI/SEC pairing makes this pack-only Vulcanian rather more tempting than some more recent offerings (*cough* Bynars *cough*). A top 25 voyage total may seem low, considering his SCI base, but when the next best option for this particular set of skills is Blood Oath Dax, it goes a lot further than it initially seems. There's no smoking gun here; just another SCI heavy Discovery toon with handsome voyage prospects and weekend use out the wazoo. Live long and suck it, Ambassador and Kal-if-fee!
