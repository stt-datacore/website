Despite whatever neat portrait Topps has graciously given Kim for his frankly awesome card art, this right winger will never be cool enough to hang out with the ladies during Saturday cadet missions or Morn on Sundays. You're primarily looking at two points of interest here, the first being some quick arena damage if you can supply the position trigger.

Secondly, an ultra valuable collection spot in the 100 threshold Costume Party. Every roster will want to immortalize Harry at some point for that (beware a build cost whose Furs come from the Ferengi Traditionalists faction) and a couple notable traits, Athlete and Musician, have a chance to be favored by WRG for stat-boosting collections in the future.
