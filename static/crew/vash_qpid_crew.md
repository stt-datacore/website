The ultimate "process over results" card. Even though she snuck into two recent mega events (one only after DB added traits to over a dozen crew just to make the event viable), a crew can have traits on the weekend, but that don't make 'em good. She may indeed catch more handfuls of bonuses, but as we're learning, trying to bet on specific traits for events can be a fool's errand. Until the Dabo wheel of events calls her number, she offers extremely poor return on investment for daily play and her best perk remains a spot in a vanity collection.
