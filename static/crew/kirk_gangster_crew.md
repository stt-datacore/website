Come sit down and let grandpa tell you about the time he used Gangster Kirk on his voyage. It was a time known as the Jazz Age. Wall Street was booming, bootleg hooch was flowing, and the young people were doing a new dance called the Charleston.

A much older card now, the daily usability just isn't there anymore for Hannibal unless you count Fizzbin instructor.  That being said, you won't find more clockwork event bonuses outside of current TV shows than the icon James T. and Gangster has the skill set to fit shuttles. He's a fine event card to snag copies of against poor or irrelevant options and is chewing his way through his traits, which already have him at multi-collection status.
