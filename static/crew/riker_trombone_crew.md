ðŸŽµWhen the jazzman's testifyin'
A faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise
Or bring you to your kneesðŸŽµ

Thereâ€™s two things Riker loves: Boning, and â€˜Boning. If heâ€™s not doing either of those, heâ€™s probably helping a newer player out during Events with his solid CMD Base and highly eventable traits (which also add Collection value). Heâ€™ll stick around on your roster longer than other Rares will thanks to a mighty +7 Attack bonus in Ship Battles. Just donâ€™t ask him to play Nightbird.
