At the time of this writing, Daniels’ previously lone variant in the game, the Legendary Temporal Agent Daniels, was rated as literally one of the worst cards of that rarity that existed.  Well, Matt Winston gets a little bit of redemption with a serviceable-at-best Super Rare, all gussied up in his United Earth Starfleet Blues.

His debut in a Skirmish event will get you 3 copies, so the question has to be if you should spend a Super Rare citation or Event pack/Recap pack pull to finish him off.  In his favor are his 3 debut collections and 2 more viable traits, and a big SEC base when his traits might garner him an event bonus.  Also a plus is his upper echelon voyage ranking for Super Rares, but the shine on that will fade for a new player as you collect fused Legendaries.

Does he have much else to offer?  No.  Might as well Finish, Freeze, and Freakin’ Forget™ Disguised Daniels, since he’s well-disguised as a compelling crew card.
