Long time players may remember Kirk from the beginning of the game where they chose one of their starting PokeCaptains (he's definitely Charmander). His strength, event tally, will largely go unrealized thanks to higher rarity options outmuscling his shuttle offerings on any given weekend. With good-not-great utility elsewhere, we’d recommend starting off with the collection magnet Sisko instead, though any of the three choices will suit you fine in both the short term and long run.
