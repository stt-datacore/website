Who would have thought that a former Miss America would be a part of your geeky roster...strange days. Best DIP/CMD shuttle pilot would be her top accolade if it weren't for a trait set low on potential. As bonus pools for her traits balloon out of control, Arandis will likely be forgotten in cryostasis. Should you end up with a complete set of four she might get a small amount of work on shuttles while your heavy hitters are out on a CMD/DIP voyage but with a non-existent event count donâ€™t expect her to do much more than add another tick on the Inspiring collection.
