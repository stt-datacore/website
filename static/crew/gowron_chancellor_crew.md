For a single star, not many crew can pack a punch like Ol' Crazy Eyes. Outside of the gauntlet, Gowron's numbers are an embarrassment, but inside the cage, he's quite the mauler. Owning the #2 DIP proficiency and DIP/SEC pair along with a few 45% trait sets is formidable ammunition, no matter how well developed your starting five is.

His hat trick of collections also presents Gowron in an interesting light. How much value can WRG pack into a crew who is sub-basement level for shuttles and voyages? While his last four stars have always been among the worst return on investment in the game, his big collections make the Trek to immortalization at least an option for endgame players.

Note that as he’s no longer 100% retrievable, you might wish to grab Gowron’s first star in a behold, even if the other options are better on paper.
