Have you ever seen those composite photos where they blur a hundred different faces together and the result is vaguely attractive, but completely generic? Double 1k bases and a big CMD proficiency look useful at a glance, but rest assured that they are not. With few eventable traits, her introductory weekend is likely to be one of the very few event bonuses she'll ever catch, and her bases just aren't good enough to be useful otherwise.

The proficiency numbers don't translate into any ranked pairs and are easily thwarted by many common gauntleteers, including in her lone 45% set. Even down to her items (Silva's Uniform, Silva's Combadge), every molecule of this card is stock standard and not someone that you want to target to upgrade any part of your game.
