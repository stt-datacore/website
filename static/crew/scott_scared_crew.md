Runaway Po thy name is Scott! Jumping into the deep end of the DIP/ENG pool comes a counterpart to (currently) one of the best SR cards in the game. Coming in at #3 for DIP/ENG voyagers, our confused looking scotsman is a very strong card for those that don't have many legendary options in that category.

His shuttle ENG is superlative for a super rare, it simply lacks opportunity as Scotty maintains red-headed stepchild status and a woeful event clip. However, for a strong DIP/ENG card that ticks off another step of the Jury Rigger list, Scared Scotty easily makes for a card worth keeping.
