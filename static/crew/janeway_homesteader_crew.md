The lesser half of the Voyager stage play Resolutions joined the game as a mid-power giveaway in 2020. While we wait for Bathtub, Man's Man Chakotay to join her (hopefully forever, in placid paradise), how much does Janeway have left in the tub? Tank, sorry.

Sitting atop a mountain of fourteen Janeway variants with SCI should ensure evergreen Faction opportunities for Homesteader, which is truer for her character than any other as Janeway boasts a 94% Faction rate for her events. Contributing the only MED skill among gold variants gives her another shuttle market to corner too.

Without much fringe usage, aside from arena evasion just fast enough to get you killed, voyages are the other area of competency for this landlubber. For a little while longer on the average roster, Janeway should be fitting some of her rarer anti-matter seats such as Exobiology or Survivalist, but this isn’t a recommended attribute to target if you’re just starting to add stars to her now.

Front-loaded with a trio of collections to round her out, Janeway is a competitive mid-level behold option whom you should be pleased to add stars to, but no longer has the stat power to command citations.
