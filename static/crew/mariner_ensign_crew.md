A serious workhorse for however long your uncommon crew are in play, Mariner is the daily use Ãœbermensch, debuting atop the base and voyage ranks with some nice arena damage to boot.

Mariner should have no problem handling cadet missions four days a week thanks to a tremendous CMD primary and a SECondary big enough to crit its share of nodes too. While her relative lack of traits hamstrings her on the galaxy map, the Animated tag salvages her collection value to an extent, while a pair of viable traits should level the playing field in that department before too long.
