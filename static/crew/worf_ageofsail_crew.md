After a few funner Worves in Midwife and EV Suit have finally broken the logjam of CMD/DIP/SEC across his variants, it's easy to dismiss Age of Sail Worf on a superficial scan. But as the man himself would say, the true test of a warrior is not without, it is within.

Despite a trait list that comes up a bit short, like his appearance on your phone’s screen, he’s got just enough juice to pull a handful of collections and some weekend bonuses to bolster Worf’s otherwise stable event history. Just barely inside the top ten SEC bases as of this writing, daily shuttle runs are well within Worf’s grasp too, along with a snazzy badge of office.

Established rosters are going to have a hard time finding much voyage work for CMD/DIP/SUCK number one billion, but thanks to a few nice anti-matter seats, he may still pop up once in a while for the average player over the course of the next year or so.

Oh, and one last thing before you go - it's retract plank, not REMOVE plank.
