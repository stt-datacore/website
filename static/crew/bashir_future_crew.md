His numbers are...less than ideal. With his most likely mega in the rear view mirror and voyage totals near the bottom of the barrel, he's certainly a card showing his age. And yet, MED/CMD, uh, finds a way. One of three legendaries with his skill set, Bashir may surprise you by joining a couple different voyage combos despite sagging totals and though his event rate has slowed, he's still a lock for work in the future.

Three ranked gauntlet pairs don't pack much punch anymore, but are usable for newer players.
