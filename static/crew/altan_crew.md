Dominating his skill set on voyages, Altan vaults pasts the bottom of the legendary voyagers to break ground and replace the old guard, even if they are two-skill golds. And on shuttles, a monstrous base lead over the next best super rare SCI option also manifests in him having the top base for ALL super rare crew.

Beyond unimpeachable daily prowess, Soong, the quintessential Innovator, also contributes a spot in a stat-boosting collection and offers just above baseline traits including 'Picard', should the ongoing show offer event opportunities down the line.
