One of the best global gift crew to date, Nog's numbers are starting to show their age, but his well-roundedness buoys his desirability as a behold pick. Quintiple(!!!!!) collections of varying exclusivity are the lede for most players, though he also offers an uncommon skill set for voyages and minor event work. Tux will rarely generate buzz, but is useful enough to be a complementary piece on a well-rounded roster.
