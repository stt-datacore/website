Being an early adopter to collections was the perfume covering his wretched musk, but now that Gowron is more average there, his sins are laid bare. You probably won’t be thawing his awful bases for events and he’s simply useless elsewhere so take the collections when you can, but this Gowron shouldn’t be any kind of priority otherwise.
