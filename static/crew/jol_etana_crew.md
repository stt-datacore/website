As with all mega event crew, it's important to remember skewed public opinion for a crew which enters the roster with a star advantage. That said, Etana is still strong, if not omnipotent. With zero events to date outside of her mega, dual 1k bases may end up largely wasted for established players. On younger rosters her ENG will no doubt catch some Faction work, but will likely be busier hauling daily shuttles instead. Her outlook is brighter elsewhere; gauntlet work suitable for new players, even if she only registers one ranked pair, and strong voyage numbers where she'll pull most of her weight. A few DIP+ENG crew with more power have been released since her appearance, but all are DIP primary which gives her the flexibility edge outside of that particular voyage combo.
