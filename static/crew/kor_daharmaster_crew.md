Nondescript or inoffensive might characterize Kor's base and voyage prospects and while those descriptors are violently at odds with one of the self-proclaimed greatest warriors in Klingon history, they don't encompass the entire card. Some fast activating arena crit rating is available at one star (thanks to a superfluously low attack boost) and more importantly, Kor claims a few collection spots including the huge Klingon collective. Even if unremarkable outside of the collections tab, Kor will still be an obligatory immortalize on your road to fleshing out late-game stat boosters.
