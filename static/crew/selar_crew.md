An absolute MED monster. The #1 MED max score which, before bonuses, scores over 900! Being a one skilled crew means she probably won't end up on many voyages however she will be useful on all weekend cadet missions and her +2000 shield regen is not to be ignored. Like Troi she will be in your roster long after her immortalisation due to her heavy MED boost and her two additional collections make her worth working on.
