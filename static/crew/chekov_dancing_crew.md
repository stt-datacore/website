If you kept a copy of the Russian jester giveaway in your inbox due to lack of space, you're probably old enough to know that he's not worth it. For everyone else, the fact that he can't be 100% retrieved is not an excuse to take him, it's a sign that he's not unique enough to be valuable. Aside from the yearly Chekov ewent, there's really only very slim collection value here at the hefty cost of five golden rings.
