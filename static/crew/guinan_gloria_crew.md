Adjust your expectations for a 3-skill MED/CMD crew; Gloria (from Cleveland) is essentially a niche gauntleteer with strong trait potential for future collections and events. She benefits from the same tailored gauntlet sets that her older sister Bartender Guinan does with proficiency just strong enough to be useful when she catches some crit value.

Gloria's collections and intriguing arena ability gives her something to offer to most kinds of players, but the lack of power and event relevance means you may need to try harder than with some crew to find spots for her to contribute to your roster.
