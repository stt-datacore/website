Katrine, Katrine, Katrine, Katrine. I’m beggin’ of you, please don't take her just because you can.

We can’t resist a song pun, but the operator of Le Coeur de Lion isn’t quite a dud. New players will appreciate a healthy CMD Proficiency paired with an absurd amount of 45% Gauntlets which should be frequent enough to find her spots to pitch in before you acquire something in the mold of Balok or Kahless.

Speaking of mold, it’s clear that there’s no daily use otherwise, but Janeway’s superb Faction Event rate and handful of Traits which surprisingly have not tallied any event bonuses *yet* should supply a reasonable number of Shuttle piloting opportunities for Katrine on the weekend. With those same Traits waiting their turn for Collection value, Katrine should hold her position in the overall rankings better than most crew moving forward despite her age.
