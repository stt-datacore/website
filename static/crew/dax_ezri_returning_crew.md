WRG makes Ezri cards about as often as Ezri goes to visit her family.  Looking like she just finished 51 different varieties of Gagh, their latest offering has some true bright spots (see what I did there?) – but don’t engrave the ‘Best New Trill Card’ trophy just yet....

From an episode of Deep Space Nine where she is dispatched by Captain Sisko to find a missing Chief O’Brien, the newly joined Ezri Dax must take her many lifetimes of memories home to see family.  Much like the episode, this newest card can function in multiple helpful roles for your roster, as long as you don’t have to pay off the Orion Syndicate.

Boasting a wide Event-count for a Super Rare, as well as strong CMD/SEC numbers to staff shuttles in Events when her 8 traits call for a bonus, Ezri will find work on young and more elderly rosters alike.  While only having 2 Collections up front, 3 or 4 more could join with her by years end.  The downside to this selection is that it comes offered to you in the lone Faction Event of the Mega Arc – leaving you to cite her or dig around in some PreCaps for her final star.

Aren’t families great? You’d look like this too if you had a ‘loving’ family like The Tegans.  Oh – is that a knock on the art quality you detect? To be frank, it’s not the worst art of the Trill Mega, but it’s not the best either.  Ezri does display one of the better Ship Abilities of the month-long awakening of new cards, giving the player a huge crit bonus with decent passives and a bit of evasion – just like her mother evades actually mothering her children.  But hey – at least Ezri didn’t turn out like her brothers – a murderer or an accountant!
