This Tendi variant is in the running for the best crew name in the history of the game, and has stirring art to match! 

Everyone’s favorite Orion, in her prior life before Starfleet as an actual pirate, enjoys several strong attributes which makes her attractive to compete for in her debut Event, or pull from Event Packs. If you’re reading this note many months later and she’s finally entered the Time Portal, consider re-evaluation appropriately due to the game’s current meta and her current rankings.

Strong Voyage power in her triplet (top five on debut) and entering the game atop her Skill order, she’ll find seating via a quintet of Anti-matter bonuses, among the top for all five. Bases are a dime a dozen these days, but if that is important to you, her initial SEC Base is top ten as well.

Enduring value for crew in this game is borne from their Trait lists, and the Mistress has an eclectic group which match three existing Collections and three more viable ones for future inclusions.
