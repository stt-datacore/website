Corny was the prototypical powerhouse MED crew and is, in some respects, still the best. There are some luminaries among the base MEDs and a few voyagers who are now on her level, but few can offer both in one package like she does.

She owns the best voyage total of any MED primary and is one of three in the 1k/1k base club to include MED. Who knows what the Disco event scene holds in the future, but even if you told me she never snags another bonus, I wouldn’t bat an eye at taking her raw power in my behold. +1 Diplomat is a nice bonus for a crew who absolutely deserves to be at 5/5 on your roster.
