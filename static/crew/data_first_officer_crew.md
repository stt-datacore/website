It's not enough that we have to look at the more controversial of Captain Jellico's two mandated uniform changes, WRG also had to inflict a particularly uncanny and Zuckerbergian visage on this poor scion of Soong. All right, don't look him in the eye and let's get it over with. First Officer Data, perhaps appropriately, lacks presence or character, but will do the job - a fully functional (and admittedly somewhat uncommon) CMD Base that'll see play in Data Events, stock Collections, and serviceable, if not impressive, Voyage power for a 2022 Super Rare. If you want a laugh, take a look at his Ship Ability, which is about the only thing as short, abrupt, and jarring as the sudden end to his thin Trait set.
