La Borg was a Tier 1 crew before the Big Book was the Big Book, but time and Borg technology have ravaged him over the years. A swiss army knife on release, the Arena work has clearly disappeared and a faster meta reigns in its place. His Voyage ability is long gone, but there is still value to be had. 

While some Gauntlet monsters now have a single roll damn near as big as two of Geordi's, he still hits 45%+ crit often enough and has the good fortune of being an ENG primary to avoid competition. Not one of your starting five, but a solid rotational player off the bench. 

Where Borgi continues to show his class is as a Collection/Event piece combo. He will pay dividends even on "complete" rosters and has enjoyed a thorough mix of variant and trait Events, despite Geordi's variant event history being heavily slanted toward Expedition and Skirmish. Two stat-boosting Collections and a Vanity round out his value, but we are not likely to see more of those given his esoteric remaining Traits.
