The third DIP/CMD/SEC mega crew in a row is probably the least impressive of the three. In a vacuum Graduayson is a fine crew (aside from the SEC skill and linguist trait. I mean, really…), but comes at a time when every player and their mothers are awash in the skill set from every angle. 

An unboosted voyage score rank debuting right around triple digits might be fine for a MED/CMD option, but not this skill set. With no fewer than twenty superior CDS voyagers ahead of her in raw power, this is a marriage of convenience for players mulling the addition of her final star.

Graduayson’s event history also bears watching. Discovery has obviously inflated the tally, but the remainder of her count rests on the twin pillars of Vulcan and Caregiver. Expecting a similar bonus clip moving forward is asking a lot of her traits.

Three paragraphs bashing a CMD/DIP/SUCK crew is a common affair around here, but there are some positives. Her fairly average collection profile comes mostly front loaded, joining the larger-than-you-think ranks of the triple collection crowd and strong bases in a shuttle-friendly skill set should find work on almost any roster. 

Amanda has value in some spots, but also brings almost all the hallmarks of a crew that will age poorly; DIP primary, poor voyage skill set, mostly tapped collection traits, few variant events… If you’re not the sort of player who automatically cites every giveaway crew, this may be one to hold at four stars for a while.
