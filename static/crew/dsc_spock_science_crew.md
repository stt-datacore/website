Just look at that event count. The event count of a thinker. A warrior. A man for all seasons. Yes, Spock is all that and more. But he is not perfect. Perhaps his greatest fault is that skill set which does him no favors as his voyage power drops out of contention.

But if Beardless Disco Spock did nothing else for your roster, he would still be quite possibly the busiest weekend warrior this game may ever see. The utility may not be off the charts, but Spock is an empire unto himself and an established event piece that you don't want to be without, especially now that he's managed to Vulcan nerve pinch his way into yet another show. With the TOS mega establishing a clear divide between Nimoy and Peck's versions of the character for event purposes, you might well find him snagging bonuses where other Spocks won't.
