A pretty fleshy, non-standard trait set is the main value driver with Trelane. The weakest table leg is events; between his poor base power and large trait pools, you may have to get several requisition shuttles deep before he pops up as an option.

Elsewhere, however, there's value. A multi-collection piece with a strong ceiling in that area can generally beat out plenty of older dud cards in a bad behold and he does earn some gauntlet play once in a blue moon. His 65% gauntlet (A.K.A. the Q Continuum set) has him as a fine inclusion and he's the #1 SEC/SCI option for all but one of his 45%+ sets.
