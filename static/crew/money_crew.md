The name of a (bad) Bond villain, but far less entertaining, you probably shouldn’t bother with Money in most circumstances. The fly in the ointment may be the total lack of SEC primary Rare female aliens if you’re trying to 2-for-1 some weekend cadet value. If you need to level Money to help you crit some Saturday nodes, take solace in her stat-boosting collection spot, which should double with the inclusion of the Marksman collection before too long.
