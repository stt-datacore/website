Depending on who you already have in your roster Cadet Nog is either going to be really useful or really pointless. He can fulfill quite a few objectives in two of the cadet challenges and adds to the Ferengi collection. But he is easily replaced with better crew available and his ship ability is not inspiring. If he does end up on a Voyage it's usually to fill out the spaces but he's not useless. Keep to collect but there are better crew to work on.
