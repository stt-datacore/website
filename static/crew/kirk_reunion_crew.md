What the 2016 is this Kirk card? Don't worry, you're not here for his aged stats or the outfit he pilfered from a 1984 Royal Caribbean cruise steward. Kirk is anxious to become fusion fodder for a monster legendary crew.

You'll want to read up on Reunion Spock and Kirk to find out what to look forward to as that's really the bulk of the value for this card. As a standalone crew, a collection and huge event tally is an alright profile for your average super rare, but his bases won't make the thaw list in many cases. The answer is 'yes' to that age old question - You think he gets used if he gets fused?
