The only Odo with SCI, Pabst leverages above average base and voyage numbers to appear a little more useful than he is. An Accuracy boosting ship ability on an eight second fuse is about all there is to otherwise recommend a determinedly milquetoast card. Overall, he’ll serve you well, just don’t expect him to be there for your child.
