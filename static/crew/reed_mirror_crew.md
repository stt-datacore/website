David Duchovny has the good fortune of collecting the Mirror trait (and associated traits) to boost his event count up into double-digits. With only the out-of-portal Mirror Sulu ahead of him for Mirror SEC and two variant-best bases, he's set up to potentially dominate several weekends in the future. 375% arena damage is a big torpedo, but getting to 12 seconds alive is increasingly difficult these days. Still a valuable Skirmish piece until you're able to acquire faster options. A minor consideration is his #4 voyage SEC - sneaky useable for a crew whose stat total sits right near the bottom of the 3-skill options.
