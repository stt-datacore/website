Typically, non-event 2-skill crew are stuffed somewhere near the bottom of many rankings. But Pulaski's yuuuge DIP is the second strongest base stat of all Super Rare crew and higher than the primary of over a dozen FF legendary crew. She'll be a shuttle anchor even going into the late game until 3/5s and better replace her.

If mid-game shuttles aren't your jam, Pulaski's inclusion in two collections including the enormous Costume Party makes her a worthwhile addition to rosters of every level.
