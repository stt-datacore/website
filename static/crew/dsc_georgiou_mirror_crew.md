Shuttle-quality CMD meets passable voyage work for a limited number of skill combos. But her daily contributions pale in comparison to her weekend potential. I've detailed a crystal ball look into Georgie's future before and why her variants may end up catching more bonuses than anyone else in STT history. But even without playing guessing games, the Empress sits at 20 bonuses triggered in the last 16 months and pairs them excellently with double 1k bases. If you're a Disco or Mirror fan, Emperor Philippa should be on your short list of crew to acquire.
