She ain't TOS' Galliulin, but she ain't bad. Irina survived the 2019 onslaught of SEC/ENG crew with only 6-pack Tribble Scotty besting her voyage power over the course of the year. That area remains her calling card and she's a straight voyage upgrade over former mega Determined Janeway, providing power that should stick around long enough for you to fuse (or cite) her. Her other components are somewhat lacklustre, highlighted by a #3 gauntlet pair which, if it's that important to you, in real terms means she shares breathing room with super rare Grand Proxy Neelix, and a spot in Jury Rigger that no longer means what it used to.
