Ethan Peck’s muscles have grown out of proportion. If we don’t stop him soon, he will eat the other crew and fill all the voyage seats himself.

One of a series of generic variants to kick off WRG’s acquisition of the Strange New Worlds license, this Spock melts into the hedges with an abysmal retrieval chance thanks to a listless trait lineup mimicked by several other variants. And while it does hamper his collection appeal somewhat, that’s where the complaints come to a full stop.

Lt. Cmdr Spock put on his big boy voyage trousers for this one. Number one debut power (by a nice margin) meets great anti-matter traits (the ones that we just panned) to overcome an all too common skill set. Crew like this are the reason it’s okay to leave all those other CMD/DIP/Somethings unfused, because you can’t justify not immortalizing this one.

Besides an almost perfunctory thumbs up event profile thanks to Spock’s household brand and worthwhile base, this crew also boasts a powerful and unique arena attribute. Just a hair off the leader for accuracy/damage combos, Spock is an arena crew you can feel absolutely ecstatic about citing up; something that’s no longer said about the likes of Captain Killy or Redjac Jaris.

Mundane though he may be in some respects, Lt. Cmdr Spock is simply too strong and too relevant to ignore and should be an instant behold (or pack) pick due to his nearly unretrievable nature.
