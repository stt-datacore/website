Thrax write-up, take two. After his release stats were posted incorrectly and the wind was sucked out of the room, let's take another look at Thrax with fresh eyes. What he offers day to day is pretty similar to past megas Kol of House Kor and Kortar, so if you have those crew, Thrax may not fill any gap in your roster. He trades in Kortar's base power and Kol's very real event potential for newer-players-only gauntlet work and a theoretically fruitful month should a future Cardassian mega roll around.
Unfortunately, the stat snafu has not affected some of the fundamental disappoints with Thrax, primarily his skill set. There are very few CMD/DIP/SEC crew worthy of citations, though if you have four copies of him already then the math gets fuzzy. The newer your account, the more use you'll get from finishing him, but in a vacuum he's not a special crew by any metric nor one worthy of honor. His pie-in-the-sky Cardassian mega month and fairly exclusive Investigator/SEC node unlock are perks worth looking forward to, even if an otherwise average crew doesn't move the needle for you.
What a difference a few hundred points can make and a good reminder that most crew are dealing in a percentage points difference. His new +300 maximum SEC proficiency hasn't done much for his gauntlet potential outside of newer rosters (still zero ranked pairs) thanks in part to an inescapably bad DIP roll, but for voyages it vaults him up nearly 90 ranks and over twenty-nine crew that share his skill set. For better or worse, he's now an even closer facsimile of the previous mega Kol of House Kor.
