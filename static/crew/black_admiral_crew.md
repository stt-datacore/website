I see a Vori
But I wanted Admiral Black
No purples anymore
I want them to turn Black

I see the dupes walk by
All names I’ve already froze
I use Trelane instead
Until my Armus shows

I see walls of Picard
But they’re not Admiral Black
Min rolls hit like a truck
Eats Surak like a snack

I've seen people shake their heads
And put their phones away
When Black’s crit’s 45
All you can do is pray

I look inside myself
My patience starts to crack
When fleetmates see him drop
And all I get is jack

Maybe now I'll trade away
My voyage token stacks
It's not easy matching up
In gauntlet without Black

No more will my Vori,
A CMD/DIP/SEC crew,
Be exciting enough
When I could have Black too

If I look hard enough
Into Chakotay’s gun
Or Keeper’s science roll
I see they’ve been outdone

Our feedback gets ignored
But I want Admiral Black
Buff drop rates or beholds
I’ll always select Black

I see the whales buy
Dilithium overload
But that won’t help me now
My envy only grows
