Let's not bury the lede - arena evasion at one second is the only notable thing about a crew who is, aptly, dry as Vulcan. But needing a full contingent of stars just to protect a small credit investment doesn't make Soval worth the behold capital. Vulcan and a handful of untapped event traits aren't supported by bases strong enough to justify selecting him for that area either.
