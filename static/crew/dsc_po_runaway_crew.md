I'm going to tell you a story.
Just a fear years ago, I tried a second account at the worst time.
A more motley lineup of event crew you've never seen, from Minuet to Harriman.
Po might actually be better than all of them combined.
Boy, I wish I had her as my starting crew and if you snagged her early, good timing!

From top to bottom, Runaway excels and hits several elite high spots.
A strong event history and voyage power, but even better are her collections.
Po has the collection count to make her an automatic behold hold for veterans.
Family runaway or not, Po is one crew you'll want to welcome with open arms.
