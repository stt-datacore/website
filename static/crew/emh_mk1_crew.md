The best 2* MED you can buy for...15k honor. That’s a lot of honor to spend on someone who doesn’t perform any better than Nurse Kes or Dr Phlox, he might have a high Base but his Max MED let’s him down quite significantly. I would only suggest buying if you really need to fill out the physician collection or really don’t like holding on honor.
