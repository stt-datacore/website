DB has been generous to the engineering landscape since Etana's appearance which, in conjunction with not having collected a bonus since then, renders her dual 1k bases rather pedestrian. She does have one of the more intriguing trait sets with a few of them sitting in the right size range for a mega, but her shuttle work to date remains on a downhill trajectory.

Still quite viable, however, is her top ten ENG/DIP voyage work. Event and campaign names may have bumped her down the list for some players, but in an extraordinary turn of events, you DO get to use more than one crew on voyages. (Very) Early game gauntlet work driven by a top ten ENG proficiency and an awkward-but-strong arena ability (where do I put my hands during Position?) give her shades of value on the periphery.
