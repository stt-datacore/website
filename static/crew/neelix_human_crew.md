Setting aside the spaghetti strand mess of logic that suggests Ethan Phillips is actually played by Neelix and not vice versa, let's lead off with the second most interesting thing about this crew; Collections. 

Notlix has picked up two Vanity Collections, two Stat-Boosting Collections, and has two more Traits in the pocket, which would give him a six-pack of inclusions (not a abdominal six-pack though, sorry Mr. Phillips).

From there he's a big step down save for Events. Hologram has been a very popular Event trait historically, while the maître d' is the best pound-for-pound DIP option among Neelix variants. You can expect one or two yearly thawpertunities.
