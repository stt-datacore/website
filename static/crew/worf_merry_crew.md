There was a time around early 2018 where Big Red, post global giveaway, would actually be a frequent player in the gauntlet. Nowadays, he rarely makes it out of mothballs, even during one of his trio of 45% gauntlet sets. But more tangible value has begun to blossom years later with his collection of collections.

Merry Worf resides in the two largest stat-boosters the game has to offer, along with a vanity for good measure. With Worf riding a multi-year hot streak for events, he's not as crazy of an investment as he used to be, even if you won't use him daily. Will Scarlett...a great Klingon and an even greater question.
