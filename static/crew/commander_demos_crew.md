Mr. Wacky Waving Inflatable would be a more impressive offering if not caught in a tidal surge of CMD/DIP/SUCK and strong voyage scores around the time of his release. With just a pair of anti-matter traits to attempt to set him apart in that area, he's a fine option there for most rosters thanks to a good debut power level, but provides low value over replacement options and is sure to be power crept many times faster than crew boasting more exotic skill sets.

Players enjoying the collection craze are going to be let down as only about 13% of gold crew lack a collection as of this writing and Demos is one of them. As long as monthly collections continue, Demos will pop up there sooner or later, but his value floor and ceiling in this area are both lower than average.

He can at least provide some daily support on shuttles when he's not voyaging. A top five CMD base debut should get him piloting on weekdays or even the occasional weekend. If you've just gotta find places to use his eye-searingly awesome art, they certainly exist thanks to a healthy power level on release, but it's hard to imagine him aging spectacularly well.
