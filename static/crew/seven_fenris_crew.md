Go go Seven Rangers~! Mighty morphin' Annika here may not seem like a great get right out of the gate, but much like a Megazord, it's in the fusion of good things that you come to something great. For one thing, she's a super rare Borg, so that niggling little collection just got a little easier for those of you who don't want to Immortalise dregs like Lore or One.

For another, much like Jodmos, she has what counts for Super Rare crew as your roster deepens and you stop relying on them for voyages - events, and uncommon bases. Consider the fact that her nearest competition for Seven SEC bases are the laughably underpowered EV Suit Seven, the outclassed Tsunkatse Seven, or the beautiful-but-dead-in-the-water Mademoiselle de Neuf, and you start to see that there's actually tremendous value in a common shuttle seat base when it's tied to a character with a strong event history.

She may not be dual-wielding, and she may not inspire you with her plain, brute strength, but she'll be an essential cog for anyone hoping to build a roster capable of making a dent in Factions. You'll freeze her, no doubt, but unlike some, she'll actually find her way out again.
