Harcourt is on thin ice, and not just with Stella. If future Disco megas shift to bridge-crew-only, this pill peddler is out of a job. His trait mega event chances may be falling like tin cans on a fence line, but his bases are still cocked and loaded to make an impact when bonuses do come along. If you need him to pitch in outside of daily shuttles, his +10 attack @ 6 seconds in the arena is a fantastic boost for fast activating crew and can bring even super rare damage options to relevance.
