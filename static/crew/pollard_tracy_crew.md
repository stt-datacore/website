A late bloomer, Pollard only stands out more over time as other skill sets explode in their number of options while strong medics remain as rare as latinum. The good doctor was 2019's sole addition to the ranks of MED/CMD crew and we thank Qod that she's a good one. Voyages are the main course here. Fret not a slipping voyage total. Exclusivity plus a powerful MED primary will have her standing out from the crowd, if her bleached white uniform doesn't do the trick. We pump the brakes a bit when it comes to shuttles. She sits atop an absurdly thin slate of 'MED and CMD' seating options and has collected fistfuls of event bonuses from the Discovery trait, but the downsides are big - 'MED and CMD' seats are rare and the Discovery event bubble seems to have burst, leaving Pollard with some ugly trait options in its wake. Pollard won't blow the roof off shuttles the way she has in the past, but everyone should try to collect options for a diverse and deep roster and Pollard is #1A for her skill pair and can pick up shuttle work even without bonuses.
