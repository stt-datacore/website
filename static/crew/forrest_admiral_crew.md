Command, Diplomacy and...Engineering? Maximillian Of The Woods is kind of an inverse Queen Po but a more relative comparison would be the Borg Queen, my oh my he keeps royal company! But in order to keep up with the Borg Queen he would need to have some more traits to call on. The raw base and voyage numbers are there to make him playable on most rosters with the requisite number of stars, it's just that the rest of him screams pack filler.

With an Enterprise mega in the rear view, Max is at the mercy of a painfully thin trait set for future Faction bonuses. No doubt you might hear some favorable stories from people who got him 4/5 from his campaign, but if you missed out, your justification to finish him when stronger crew come your way will primarily rest on the Diplomat collection.
