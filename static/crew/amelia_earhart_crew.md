Hailing from an all-time bad episode of Trek is one way to be remembered. Another is to own some serious in-game power. Ms. Earhart was tucked away in a weekday pack alongside President Lincoln and so may have been overlooked by some, but now that she's in the portal, it's time to snap up this diamond in the rough. If you owned her for the Pilot mega to close out 2018, congratulations on your enormous advantage over the field. With a 2019 curtain call, she came back better than ever boasting a ~300 point lead over the next likely option for another month (because who the hell has a FF Tosk?).

It's hard to see her squeeze much more weekend relevance from her traits (cultural figure?), but her elite base can't be denied the rest of the time as it sits top five even a year and a half after release. Her shuttle potential is obvious, but even more impressive was her reign as the top voyage ENG for over a full calendar year. Even in the face of several recent ENG additions, her voyage metrics are strong and grant her great job security on any roster. To ensure that, and help make up for any event deficiencies, Earhart snags two spots in the gauntlet rankings, including a DIP/ENG pair capable of 2-for-1ing The Caretaker.
