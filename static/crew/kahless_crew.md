The age old and fittingly Honorable question; is Kahless worth his price tag? As a recovering Kahless truther and fool from Quinlat, even I have to admit he’s been distilled down to pure, sweet luxury.

His primary point of interest, the gauntlet, provides his greatest competition for free. Gauntlet exclusive Balok matches Kahless' average CMD roll exactly while sporting better overall power and flat out dumb amounts of big crit gauntlets. Dumber still is the even crittier Tribbled Koloth and Korax who ended Kahless’ CMD/SEC reign in crit-neutral situations while being the better inclusion in most cases due to the versatility afforded him by a lovely ENG tertiary.

With Kahless’ voyage ability tamped down pretty thoroughly from the flood of CMD/DIP/SUCK options, even considering a few nice anti-matter traits, it’s up to his trait list to provide all his value via collections and big crit gauntlets where he can still excel, even if only as a rotational piece.

If you’ve already taken the plunge, the next question is 'should I cite?'. The answer will depend on who you ask, but unless he’s granted some exclusivity in the form of an Honor Hall collection, you can get his non-gauntlet goodies elsewhere and for cheaper. In either case, he remains an intriguing and valuable choice; another option for your honor.
