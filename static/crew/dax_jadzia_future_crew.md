Alternate Future Jadzia Dax was notable as the last Jadzia to enter the game before a five year drought we call the “No Jadzia Desert”. In terms of daily use, this crew is as decrepit as Michael Westmore caught to make Terry Farrell look for this episode, but her pedigree as a Dax and her Trait list have given her work a half dozen times each of the last two years. Two Collections are below average as it stands, but she has Traits to double that number when they’re called to duty.
