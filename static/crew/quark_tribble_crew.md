Tribble Quark's honor of being the second best Ferengi crew is kind of like beating a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest - it doesn't take much. But for a crew who's easy to overlook thanks to blunted base and voyage ranks, Quark is still a worthwhile card.

On voyages, he's pretty much as advertised by his score rank. Good traits battle to a stalemate with an increasingly available skill set, making him more of a option because you probably got four stars for free in his mega rather than on his own merits.

Quark's eccentric trait list fares better elsewhere as it's rocket-fueled him to over a dozen events in 2021, the year he debuted, and has him in two collections so far. A strong arena attack boost can and should be replaced by an option with instant damage built-in, but is at least usable if he's one of your favorites and helps round him out as a crew who can contribute.
