Formerly the number one overall Voyager in the game, this human/canine duo enjoyed a less-than-lengthy reign atop the ranks, and have fallen fast due to a combination of Power Creep™, and an all-too-common Skill set.

Still a viable Voyager, Porthos and his owner own a solid six Antimatter seats, but don’t enjoy priority seating on any of them due to their common nature among the Voyagers ahead of them in the ranks. 

The good news is that due to strong Primary and Secondary Bases in CMD and DIP, and a renaissance of sort for Archer and Enterprise Events, they’ll ride Event Shuttles with great aplomb. A quartet of Collections, including a Vanity, and two more viable Traits, makes them still a solid long-term investment for Legendary Behold choices and Crew Retrievals, even if you aren’t going to prioritize them for Voyages anymore.
