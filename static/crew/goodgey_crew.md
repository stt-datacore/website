Released in the Ubercampaign, Goodgey may be considered among the best to be introduced via this release mechanism. A solid ENG-led Skill set with Voyage power to boot may draw the eye initially, then you might slide over to a set of four Collections and a Trait list with a little juice left for the future. But the main attraction might be in his Ship Ability, wherein TPG has finally broken the mold and released a 25% Hull Repair crew with a less than 20s Cycle Time, with Goodgey coming in at 18s. A best-in-class Attack Boost (for a Hull Repair Crew) lets you easily slot him into your Fleet Boss Battles quartet and will make it easier and easier to time out the Doomsday Machine. If you’re apt to spend on the game but only sometimes, you might consider this Ubercampaign a good(gey) value.
