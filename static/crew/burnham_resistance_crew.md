One of two bookend CMD/DIP/SEC giveaway crew in 2021, on the heels of another CDS Burnham variant, on the heels of back to back CDS mega recurring crew, sandwiched between CDS event crew... Suffice it to say, if you stay current with Timelines, Resistance Burnham is a crew you don't need.

With Burnham's voyage power lagging behind all of the aforementioned CDS crew from around the time of her release, the only reason she should be making more than one or two runs for you is because of fusion level, not on her own merits. And if you're reading this by the time she enters the portal, then you *really* shouldn't be shelling out behold capital for this part of her game.

That being said, Burnham is eternal and the same boring skill set that smothers the voyage ranks never hurts for shuttle seating. As the top Burnham DIP option she will be useful, if replaceable, in that area. With her traits not giving her much event help and capping her potential collection value, Resistance is primarily an event piece that doesn't cover new ground.
