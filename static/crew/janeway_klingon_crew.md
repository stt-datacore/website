Formerly a SEC/SCI voyager of note, Klingway is now hundreds of ranks lower than the kind of power you'd like to employ there, but she still packs a plethora of peripheral perks. For starters, Janeway has an astonishing 93% Faction rate across her events, which all but guarantees that you'll have no trouble putting the #1 Janeway SEC to work a few times each year.

Ship-friendly too, Janeway might act as +1 crew slot, if you choose to swap her in over your Ardra. The super rare Skirmish queen has crit bonus in unmatched amounts, but Klingway's accuracy boost and initialization times are superior. The cherry on top; a spot in the gigantic Klingon collection wherein Janeway is one of the better options for immortalizing.
