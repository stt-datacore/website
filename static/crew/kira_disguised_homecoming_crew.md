This isn’t the Disguised Kira you’re looking for, but this pale imitation does have one or two perks. Most notable is the Kira brand, which is in the mix among the most reliable and notable event names in the game. Remarkably consistent year to year, this variant also has a few traits whose absence from the event tally list is a mild surprise.

The rest of her value is fairly theoretical. In the gauntlet, you’ll find that SEC rolls are a dime a dozen and lacking third skill utility is generally a no-go, but fresh rosters forced into beholding her can probably squeeze a few wins out of her, particularly with elevated crit values. The Big Book’s proprietary potential collection rating (based on the trait’s Scrabble score) also likes Kira’s traits for future collections, even if she’s clearly a late adopter in that regard.

We can’t promise you’ll notice Kira’s presence on your roster most of the time, but that’s just par for the course with old and/or 2-skilled crew.
