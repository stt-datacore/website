Let’s face it, most of the Montgomery Scott Legendary variants in the game can generally be characterized as “Scotty, Not Hotty”.  Sure, Tribble Herder had a decent run, but has fallen victim to WRG’s Warp 9.975 Power Creep™ as many old stalwarts have over the last year or so.  And Demo Man has his use in FBB and for daily shuttles (snicker).  Our first Scotty in the Monster Maroons™ is this darling Chief Engineer variant, but will he have any staying power?!

Let’s talk good, bad, and ugly for this ST:VI variant!

Good: Top 20 SEC base for daily shuttles (snicker) and the rare Scotty event.  6 antimatter voyage seats, including the tough-to-staff Hero, and a strong SEC/ENG/CMD skill order near the top of the triplet, battling it out with peers Krem, Captain Braxton (boy, what staying power!) and the webstore exclusive who shall not be named.  Ship ability: +10 Attack 400% boom, but a slowish 8s activation and a 2 use limit.

Bad: Gauntlet - no utility.  Current collections - goose egg!  But, silver lining - 4 possible future inclusions, of which 3 are viable and 1 is Desperate.

Ugly: The Monster Maroon itself!
