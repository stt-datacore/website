Marine Janeway here is so very nearly a great card. She has the #3 CMD base but not a great deal of proficiency bonuses and her ship ability is a plain +5 Attack. Her voyaging score isnâ€™t the best but her primary use will be for CMD nodes on Saturday cadet missions. Once they are taken care of feel free to freeze or throw as required.
