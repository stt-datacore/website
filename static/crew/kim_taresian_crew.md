We had a scare when Captain Kim made us think that his character might have decent representation going forward, but DB set things right and sent Kim back to the shadow realm. With the card art being his most menacing attribute and a flaccid skill set, this is a crew you’ll forget about until you search your cryo vault the week before an event. Kim’s arena evasion is his only particularly notable attribute, but with six second burst crew lurking and a growing number of Kraytons cruising around, his eight second initialization may be too slow for the Admiral division moving forward.
