It would be cheap for us to take a victory lap for Courier's previous note being spot on - some crew profiles are simply easier to extrapolate.

If you're coming to this Burnham variant fresh or still mulling a last star, it's much easier to pass on her at this point than on day one. CMD/SEC doesn't need any voyage help on most rosters and Courier's power there isn't close to the right part of the bell curve, so she's just another name at this point, even if she would make a run here and a run there.

The event work still remains fine, but be wary of Disco's influence on what looks to be a rock solid event history. 2021 exposed the relative weakness in her traits and so while Burnham variant will never hurt for event work, her bonus rate will continue regressing to between two and six per year, rather than double that.

Thin collection value to try and round her out includes the obnoxiously large Resourceful collection and few traits which we can't pronounce as possibilities down the line. Courier was ok to finish if you were current with her mega, but the best course of action at this point would be to let beholds build her slowly and use her partially fused in events where possible.
