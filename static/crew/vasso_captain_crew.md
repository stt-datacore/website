He looks like he just tried the “pull my fingers” trick on Pike, but Vasso won’t be laughing for long. Already bettered on voyages by mega peer Doopler Emissary, it’s easy to empathize with Vasso’s radical lack of anti-matter traits and lost voyage childhood.

As we search elsewhere for value, there’s a pit stop to be made at a modest collection profile before ending up in the shuttlebay. Strong base metrics are going to be gobbled up by the incessant DIP base power creep monster. It doesn’t bleed, it doesn’t feel pain or fear…we cannot stop it. What looks like a great daily use option on day one will slip into double digit ranks before you can say “I should go do the security things.”
