Tuvok's wings have been clipped compared to his soaring heights on release. Voyages are beyond his capabilities if you have comparable skill set/fuse level options and his powerful attack boost on ships is slow enough that you can generally find (or retrieve) better options.

But there's good value in a multi-collection piece who also enjoys an event mèlange of Tuvok, Vulcan, and Borg events while sporting the right shuttle skills to boot. There are reasons for almost every roster to snag stars on Tuvok in a behold, even if he does more of his heavy lifting post-cryo these days.
