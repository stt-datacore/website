The massive Worf/Klingon/Hologram event count and vanity collection are certainly nice, but his stats and skill set tell the story of a crew whose likely ceiling is as a fourth Faction shuttle seat warmer. No lack of opportunity to excel there, but he has quite an expensive build consisting of over 100 faction items and pricey components.
