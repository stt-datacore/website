Some may consider Lursa superfluous for Weekend Cadet work considering her CMD base sits between the more versatile Tourist Dax and Saavik, yet she's still an option there with great top-end CMD and SEC rolls if you manage to snag her before the others.

But Timelines' Kollection nesting doll is something of a two-for-one as she not only provides a notch on the Klingon Collection (after a fairly Faction item-heavy build), but is also the gateway to a Fusion with her sister B'Etor for another Super Rare to tick that Collection upwards and help you boost your Ship's Attack value. Long after she’s frozen, you may find Lursa give you notches on two more stat-boosting Collections as WRG fills them out month after month.
