Don't get suckered in by Portal's third skill or token amount of ENG, this is a crew with two traits, zero events (as of this writing), and zero daily usefulness. He sits firmly entrenched among the worst legendary crew in the game and doesn't deserve a second glance until both Duelist and Telepath are collections.

P.S. Bring back the energy whips.
