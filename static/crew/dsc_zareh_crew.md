Panned for launch day-type numbers right from the start, Zareh hasn’t exactly fared any better over time, although his new player attributes abide.

Proficiencies unsuitable for mature audiences are robust enough to ekke out work for fresh faced Timelines players and include a trio of 45% gauntlet sets thanks to traits which we promise will be collections before too long. (You said that last time, jerks.)

Another attribute of circumstance; an arena attack boost which is a hair slower than optimal and comes with an unfortunate handicap for rosters whose battles tend to last a little longer. But a strong attack boost is an important acquisition and Zareh’s cost to fuse is far cheaper than going straight for a legendary option.
