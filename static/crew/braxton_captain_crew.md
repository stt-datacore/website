Of course his numbers are great, he's from the future! Braxton owns the #1 overall voyager and voyage CMD spots (makes sense, it's not like his crew mutinied and threw him in jail). As of this writing, his lead over voyager #25 is the same gap between #25 and #160. If you're a stats queen, as the kids say, then Braxton's the one you want. His voyage work will hog the attention and rightfully so, but he's not too shabby elsewhere either. In the gauntlet, his lone ranked pair comes in ranked #1 for ENG/CMD. Be warned, that skill combo is sprinkled with super rare crew and its scoring potential is lower in general, but #1 is #1. He can rotate into your team with two good-not-great single rolls for CMD or ENG gauntlets.

There was enough meat on the bone after factoring out Braxton's rather robust proficiency numbers to leave him with a worthwhile CMD base. With such poor event chances, you may want one of the many Discovery or Main Cast characters if you're looking to add a CMD base in particular, but as just another attribute for a sterling crew it's a nice addition and should provide handy support for daily shuttles.
