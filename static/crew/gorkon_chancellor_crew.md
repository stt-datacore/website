Non-event CMD/DIP/SEC paints a certain picture on the behold page, but Gorkon is fantastic. His huge DIP base was just recently passed over as the best Klingon DIP in the game, but is still tremendous and he adds voyage power in an amount that can overcome his common skill set. In the arena, he sports a Kirk-like 500% instant damage off cloak, though at 10 seconds.
