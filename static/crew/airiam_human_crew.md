Nothing particular exciting about Airiam aside from her fantastic attire for beachwear. A lack of proficiencies hurts her voyaging power and although her SCI base is good it's not enough to prioritise her over better cards. No traits, no collection and a poor ship ability hinder her usefulness. A one-day cadet help on the weekend, she comps (poorly) to the crew you really want to level for the early game:

Mom, I want Mister Saavik.

We have Saavik at home.
