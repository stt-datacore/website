Do Klingons have balls? No, I mean balls, like to dance at. Bedazzling gold threads and nail polish to match makes one think that they might.

A Discovery Klingon copy/paste note might be defensible here, as there’s really not a ton of variation. Aged stats and a boring skill set makes her a voyage non-starter, but L’Rell’s traits do their part and then some to comprise all of her value via events and collections. She’s a fine mid-to-low end behold or retrieval project for established players, but new rosters will want to look for more daily usage than what Mom offers.
