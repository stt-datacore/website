Albert, or “Mack Daddy” as his friends call him (*citation pending), likes robots. They’re very efficient. Much like WRG, who have been efficiently churning out BigBase™ and upper-tier Voyager crew so much lately they seem to negate each other at every turn. Everyone’s favourite Irishman is naturally both of these things.

Let’s start with that BigBase™. Mack Attack pips recent past, and fellow Campaign Crew, Nel Apgar by one point here. In fact, the top three SCI bases have all come out within the last five months, and this note will probably become outdated in just a few more. As we here at the BigBook like to remind folks, there are only so many seats on a Voyage and Shuttles can only get so difficult. He may have by far the top O’Brien variant SCI base (as there’s only two of them), but it’s otherwise the law of diminishing returns. Don’t let this negativity diminish your opinion of Big Mack, however, as he should be good for a few events a year where Base is king. 

Not just a one-trick pony, Mack the Knife debuts at or near the top of his Voyage triplet and pairing, finding a place alongside former Mega recurrings and even the mythical Voyage Exclusive Admiral Black. Elderly rosters in search of the elusive 14 Hour Natural will find that he offers small bumps up across a few AM seats, and newer accounts looking to maybe spring for the ÜberKampaign can add a quick new punch to their roster.

Unfortunately, much like his on-screen persona, ol’ Mack and Cheese falls a bit flat otherwise. Until WRG gives us the Far Beyond The Stars Collection (no, dear reader, I will not stop talking about this til it happens), we will have to be happy with his spot in its surrogate, Story Time, as well as two other Stat-Boosting ones. So sit back with a pipe, look for your matches, and wait til the next Campaign, Giveaway, or Mega-Recurring takes his place.
