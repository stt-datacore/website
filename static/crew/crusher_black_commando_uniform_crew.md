The Golden Goose for all areas of the game. Seriously I consider her one of the best 3* cards available. Letâ€™s start with the #1 MED Base stat which will destroy most nodes she is capable of. 200% damage in ship battles makes her absolutely needed for Arena and Skirmish events. A diverse skill set that gets her on most voyages and with the physician trait, more antimatter and collection bonuses.
