Let's be real - Grendel would have kicked Beowulf Kim's ass without breaking a sweat. Kim's voyage rank is somewhere in the thousands, though he does have value elsewhere.

This space previously panned Kim's wretched bases and while it's true that Kim's event history had been extremely light on Factions, he still picks up more bonuses than you might expect for an always-Ensign and a handful of traits have sprinkled additional value here and there.

Somewhat "essential" for his not-quite-vanity collection, Kim is probably not the worst crew you can immortalize if you love Lucy and his value in the collection trophy case is often his biggest selling point. Collectors don't seem to have a problem giving fair haven to Maggie O'Halloran's boyfriend, but if you're looking to upgrade the daily part of your game, let Beowulf rot in the holobuffers until Doc comes to the rescue.
