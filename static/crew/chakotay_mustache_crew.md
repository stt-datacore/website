Commander Generic debuted as a daily use option, but now that the bloom is off the rose, there's just scattershot event opportunities and a somewhat low collection ceiling left standing. Having at least one collection should save him from the first wave of low-on-space airlocks and give him some appeal to veteran players, but you could go years without saying the phrase "Gee, I'm glad I have Resolute to thaw for this run of Chakotay events!"
