Second highest 1* SEC with some very useful traits for unlocking nodes. Fills the cardassian collection and will assist in the Tuesday cadet missions. Sadly his ship ability is pretty poor and being SEC only means his usefulness is limited past a certain point. Keep for collection but his traits and stats combined will only get you so far. Constable Odo is a good replacement to fill the same needs.
