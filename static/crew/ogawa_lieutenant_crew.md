Yes, Ogawa (and several hundred other legendaries) has a couple of collections, but let's jump to the meat and potatoes; voyages. She is essentially a straight Warship EMA refresh, which is an even bigger compliment than what it may sound like.

For those who say of EMA, "Yea, I still use him here and there", keep in mind that's after several years of stat decay and for those of you who still run Doc regularly, Alyssa should look even better. You can count on one hand the number of legendaries in her skill set and all seven of her traits will trigger for anti-matter bonuses.

Tactician in particular will come in extremely clutch. It appears on every seat except MED, but the entire list of Tacticians who have the MED skill is as follows; EV Suit Worf's tertiary, Delta Flyer Paris' tertiary. That's as close as it gets to a tailor-made seat and headlines the myriad lineup combinations that will find use for Ogawa on your voyages. 

We've shied away from heartily endorsing "voyage only" crew investments in the past, but hats will be eaten if Ogawa doesn't provide a bare minimum of three years of voyaging on every roster out there, with an extra year or two tacked on if you're not at the helm of a 14-hour chasing, pack-gobbling endgame roster.
