Iggy Pop! Yes, the Godfather of Punk has come to Trek, but alas, his card is nowhere near as top tier as his music. +1 Diplomat is always nice, as is a secondary SCI (the only Dominion crew to have it), but bad bases and merely competent proficiencies mean he's destined for the freezer rather than shuttles or Gauntlet. You might find him helpful on your voyages and he's one of the better options for clearing a [_tricky node_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Feed_A_Fever), but he'll find himself squeezed out before long. That being said, Dominion events will help keep your [_lust for life_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQvUBf5l7Vw) burning long after he's shuffled off to the freezer.
