La Borg was a tier 1 crew before the Big Book was the Big Book, but time and Borg technology have ravaged him over the years. A swiss army knife on release, the arena work has clearly disappeared and a faster meta reigns in its place. His voyage ability is in its twilight, if not gone completely on mature rosters. But there is still value to be had.

While some gauntlet monsters now have a single roll damn near as big as two of Geordi's, he still hits 45%+ crit often enough and has the good fortune of being an ENG primary to avoid competition. Not one of your starting five, but a solid rotational player off the bench.

Where Borgi continues to show his class is as a collection/event piece combo. He will pay dividends even on "complete" rosters and has enjoyed a thorough mix of variant and trait events, despite Geordi's variant event history being heavily slanted toward Expedition and Skirmish.
