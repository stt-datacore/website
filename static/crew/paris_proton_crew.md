Captain Proton has been featured event crew four times and owns a reliable Paris event clip which should give subpar bases at least an oppotunity to pitch in. And there's his double collections and usable arena evasion to round him out well.

But then you get to a torturous build cost consisting of 132 basic holoprograms, dozens of other faction items, and piles of components that may as well be made of latinum. Youâ€™ll want him eventually for those event features and collections, but make sure your inventory can take the hit of his build cost before starting this replicator project.
