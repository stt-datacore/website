NS Tucker is a blend of useful attributes and ineffective numbers. His best rank to be found, a top five ENG proficiency, translates into a top five ENG/DIP gauntlet pair behind some rather uncommon crew and at least gives his one bullet a chance to take down The Caretaker. His skill set used to command more use on voyages, but recent additions like mega Etana Jol have stolen some work from him. He's a roster-sensitive tool there, but at least has a chance for work compared to his CMD/DIP/SEC brethren.

Trip has only recently hit a half dozen events, but NS Tucker has exactly the kind of traits that set the wheels turning in our mind. Romantic mega event in February? Costumed in October? A surprising amount of Tucker's value comes from his two exclusive collections. He's a must for Western, but almost equally so for Jury Rigger which in its current state requires a few legendary crew to complete and has a lot of bad options.
