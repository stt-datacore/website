This Archer is unfortunately not a recommended target for any roster. His Pilot and Explorer traits do come up on a handful of M/W/F Starfleet Cadet Missions and he could perform fine for that purpose, but the lack of broader usability in a period of play where resources and Trainers are precious means that you'll want to look for a better all-rounder. If either of those Traits hits on a Collection in the future, feel free to re-visit his place in your Immortalization queue.
