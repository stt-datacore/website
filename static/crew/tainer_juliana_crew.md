Tainer is a strong B-level player in two important areas of daily play; gauntlet and voyages. Though she lacks a huge single proficiency roll, her overall total and strong SCI/MED pair can be worth inclusion in your fave five, especially with crit. Outside of Defensive Phlox, that skill pair rarely produces walls of superior crew and Tainer will often feast on the scraps of leftover Caretakers.

While a lack of traits and a low base percentage may cause certain voyage calculators to eschew her, she nevertheless performs at just under an elite level there. What her traits lack in anti-matter chances, they make up for with collection potential and should ensure her multi-collection value before too long. TL;DR Data's mom has got it goin' on.
