If CMD strength is something you are looking for then J.M. Riker is a fairly good contender. His base stat isn’t amazing but it does have a strong proficiency bonus and his combination of skills and traits will make him a lot of voyages. But that’s not his redeeming feature, he has a very strong +7 Attack bonus which, paired with attack speed or crit bonus, will make short work of Skirmish enemies in the Captain stages. His shortcomings however mean you lose some evasion bonus with the ship skill and his DIP score is not the most useful on outgoing shuttles.
