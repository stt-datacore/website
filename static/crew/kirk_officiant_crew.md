I now pronounce you Big Book reader and DIP/CMD/SUCK. You may now eat the Shelbyville skill set lemon.

Joining the ultra-exclusive group of crew featuring excellent props in their art, Officiant Kirk looks just about ready to find out if he's the Weakest Link or not - and, save for the obvious bummer of a skill set and a zilch in ship battles or Gauntlet, he actually isn't. Any card with a 1200+ base (with all bonuses applied) is going to be, if not event gold, at least event silver, Officiant showcasing the Kirk pedigree that allows for a really deep shuttle run if you're so inclined to compete in the next applicable Faction. 

The skill set may indeed be a drag, but the numbers are there for a strong early game voyager, at least until WRG spits out another giveaway gold with the same stats, e.g. Chef Pike, Kai Winn, etc., and while he's effectively tapped out at three collections, they're at least ones with a lot of dross you'd rather find alternatives to. As is becoming increasingly the vogue, he's liable to be frozen sooner rather than later, but unlike a lot of Super Rares, you might actually find yourself bothering to unfreeze him, which is becoming less and less common these days. Now, full speed to Outpost Four, where I'm sure nothing bad will happen . . .
