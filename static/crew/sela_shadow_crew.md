Sporting hair reminiscent of Darth Helmet, Sela is thankfully less of a clod. Open her voyage panel on this page and click the blue “cmd/eng/dip” link to see why you want her. With a wasteland of a skill order in one hand, some very juicy and exclusive anti-matter traits in another, and a dead senator in the other, I ask you, Captain, what conclusion would you draw?

Draw is the key word for this Artist’s Day Off variant as Sela will also be drawing on traits to pump up the rest of her value. Repeated collection expansions and a limited pool of Romulans to draw on should see her keep that collection’s value afloat for a while, while most of the rest of her traits are in line for future collections. They also drive all of her event chances and you know that faction events rarely hurt for CMD seating. The rare blend of usefulness and flavor makes Sela a fine citation or behold candidate for future fusion.
