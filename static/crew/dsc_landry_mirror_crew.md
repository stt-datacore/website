If you’re at the stage of the game where you can afford to scout out perfectly serviceable Faction pieces, then congratulations - Mirror Landry is definitely that, and since finishing the Mirror collection requires you to go through a good few golds (at least for now), the sting of taking a SEC/CMD two skiller is lessened . . . somewhat.

That being said, a seeming end to blanket Disco event bonuses means that you’re pinning your hopes on Mirror (which is not nothing) and Villain (definitely still viable) for any kind of regular work - and even there, she’s only #5 for both pools, with all the options above her offering more in the way of ancillary benefits. If you take her, take her because there’s nothing better so that you can still look at yourself in the mirror.
