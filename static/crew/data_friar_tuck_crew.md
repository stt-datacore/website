Friar Tuck is the top voyager in his skill set and has plenty of events and traits. His bases aren't outstanding, but manage to avoid the ENG logjam from so many other legendary Datas and will perform nicely for SEC/DIP event shuttles instead. Take note of his expensive build cost including a fistful of Sec 31 items, but he will pay off the investment when finished.
