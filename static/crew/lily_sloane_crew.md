The fact that she has "variants" now predisposes Lily to the possibility of future events, but two events in six years tells you all you need to know about that. A weak ENG primary that hurts for event seating also diminishes the chance of her even making it out of cryo for a sudden uptick in trait events.

The highlight, and justifiable reason to behold her, is her strong set of collections. There’s even theoretical room for expansion, though most of it hinges on another WRG ‘oopsie’ that would bring us the likes of Desperate or Civilian megacollections.
