Thin utility for this two trait wonder comes either on ships where he laps the cadet field with heaps of crit bonus or in the collections tab where he’s a mere “and one” for midgame players looking to flesh out their boosts. Until you’re in that area of the game, feel free to pass on building him which will require a few dozen faction items, but a relatively light amount of chronitons.
