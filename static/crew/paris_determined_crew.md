I've gotta take a little time
To stop hostile Klingon takeovers
I better read between the lines
Before I get my wife's cold shoulder

Now it's bat'leth practice time
With stiff leather upon my shoulders
Through the crowd I see bloodwine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

On his knife I see lots of bloodstains
I thank God that Kohlar helped me to train.
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I want to know what love is
B'Elanna can show me
I want to feel what love is
This T'Greth can blow me
