"Every time you look at the SCI/ENG voyage ranks, you're looking at me." The bi-annual refresh card comes in many flavors, and Ms. - sorry, Mrs. - Brahms' flavor is, unfortunately for those of you with a penchant for Susan Gibney cards (come on, Benteen!), decidedly vanilla.

Two of her traits that don't state the biological facts have both been tapped for megas, which might leave as much of an event future for Leah as there is for Geordi's love life. The arena evasion is nice, but 'slow' and laden with a trigger requirement that might as well leave it DOA in the current ship battle meta.
