Meet the woman responsible for single-handedly annihilating the Diplomacy skill. Before her appearance, the gaps between #1 and the base ranks below were 6, 9, 6, 4, and 2. Her lead over then-#1 Odo is 238. Her DIP base at 1/5 tops dozens of 5/5 DIP crew like Smitten or Mambo Picard. This is what power, unlimited power! Looks like.There's never been such a huge domination of the ranks like that before and if she were Professors Data, Dax, or Burnham, then she would be among the most valuable crew in the game.

Luckily for those who don't have her, Sato sits at three total events with few traits likely to trigger a bonus. But the rest of the time, she is the quintessential shuttle anchor and will frequently find work for faction events that feature more SCI/ENG-focused crew whose variants lack DIP options. Her voyage work is serviceable and a dash of SCI will help break up any CMD/DIP/SEC logjams ahead of her. A singular crew, Sato will easily stand out on your roster, even if the value of what she excels at is up for debate.
