Did you know that Verad Dax is actually a codename? It means Ver(y B)ad (Haircut) Dax - seriously, go back and watch Invasive Procedures, and watch Verad go from a co-star on Dumb and Dumber to that rather more slick, almost Superman curl he's sporting in this art. Clearly the symbiont comes with a dollop of hair gel, who knew? What it also comes with is a bucketload of events, since Verad does in fact count for all the Dax events of past, present and future, despite having only been joined for a grand total of 30 minutes, and his grab bag of traits have netted him work besides, where he'll easily be able to leverage his fairly weighty top ten SEC base.

While he drops with zero collections to his name, pretty much every trait (except Civilian and Desperate; they may be on the board, but they're not REALLY on the board) is viable for expansion, meaning that if you're past the point of needing even excellent SR voyagers - and he is excellent, if not quite elite - you'll likely see his value only increase as he sits in the vault collecting frost. Where Verad will truly shine, however, is on ships, where a 6s timer, a lack of trigger, and 300% damage leaves him sitting pretty behind only Vindicta Mariner when it comes to 4* damage dealers. If only he was't handicapped by the Trill Symbiosis Commission - er, I mean, his two charge limit, he'd be the new Fleet Boss Battle meta, but as it is, he'll have to be satiated with being merely incredible in Arena and for Skirmishes. Not bad for a communications clerk, eh?
