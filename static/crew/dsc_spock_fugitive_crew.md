Having dropped a chunk of daily usability from his overall profile, Fugitive Spock can still boast a simply absurd event history that tops the list of all 1200 crew as of this writing. Even discounting Disco megas going forward, Spock’s down years are better than a lot of cards’ career years and his base is still worth the thaw for almost all of them.

Like most Spocks, Fugitive also has a proper trait list (which his event list can testify to) to all but guarantee average or better collection value in any given month. Newer rosters that are able to fuse Fugitive early on could benefit from a handy SEC/SCI voyage stack or worthwhile SCI base, but it’s his long term value that dominates the headlines.
