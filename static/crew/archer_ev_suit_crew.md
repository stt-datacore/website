Late bloomer Archer will never be a major event player, but after his slow start has picked up a few events per year including a pair of 2020 Factions. No longer a serious consideration on voyages, EV Archer is in the 'toolbox' phase of his career - a fine base for a smattering of variant and trait events, along with dual collections which don't currently need him, but may in the future.
