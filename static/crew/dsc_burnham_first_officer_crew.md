FOB was once the poster child for return on investment, but after almost six years in the game, she has finally been power crept into Voyage oblivion.  However, she remains an Event boss, grabbing fistful after fistful of Event bonuses. With Disco Mega Events reanimated in 2022, she no longer has to settle for merely 'very reliable' variant Event work going forward to highlight a huge CMD score that can even perform non-bonus work admirably. Slow, triggerless Arena damage is a great new player perk, but unfortunately FOB is no longer the “choose from a Behold and insta-cite” endorphin rush that she was in years past.  Traited fairly narrowly, Burnham enjoys only two Collections now and is a shoe-in for one more, maybe two.  You may still want to snag her from a Behold when you can, since she cannot be guaranteed via Crew Retrieval.
