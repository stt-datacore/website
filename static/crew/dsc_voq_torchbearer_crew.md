Just when it looked like Disco events were being written off, in comes the Klingon collection to boost Voq's spirits and his value. Voq is an amalgam of attributes which are frankly more interesting than they have any right being. His #1 voyage score (now 'merely' top ten) was the talk of the town for quite a while, but as it faces more competition and the skill set itself is dead weight, he's less powerhouse and more of simply a great early-to-mid game voyage option.

Also available for newer players are over a half dozen 45% and 65% gauntlet trait sets which, despite the increased skill set competition, should find him spotty work for several months. And triggerless, if slow, arena damage allows you to eschew cards whose niche is only that, such as Professor Scott. Double collections make him essential for late game players looking to finish the massive group of Klingons (a murder of Klingons?) and make him surprisingly well-rounded for a crew who's not a brand name.
