One of the less "Mega" mega crew in retrospect, at least by the numbers, but still a sturdy card. His SEC sits 4th among Klingon crew, which is his primary event consideration. That'll cut it for a Faction event and those who have him at 5/5 from his mega will likely tell you he's been manning shuttles for them for a long time. There's been a glut of CMD/DIP/SEC voyagers added lately and so his power has sunk to merely average with a replaceable skill set.
Though there is nothing elite about him, Kortar as a package should still have the potential to outperform many older cards. If he's sitting at 4/5 on your roster from his events, the window on him being a good investment has probably passed; let beholds take care of FFing him and use the honor on one of the many new powerhouses introduced regularly.
