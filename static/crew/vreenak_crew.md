No, I won't say it. And Vreenak isn't a fake, though perhaps underpowered. We're unlikely to see too many Senator or Tal Shiar events, so if you're looking to put his stats to work, you're banking on Romulan events, of which there's only been one standalone. For more such weekends in the future, he's the #2 Romulan DIP behind the far more useful Romulan Picard. He's really more of a character choice, but at least he hits two collections if you take him to max for sentimental reasons.
