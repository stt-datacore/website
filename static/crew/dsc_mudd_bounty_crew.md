Boobs Mudd is better known for his art than anything statistically. That's not to say he's a bad card, but he doesn't offer anything particularly unique. He's a plus voyager in a vacuum, though players who have been around through any portion of 2019 have probably seen several ENG/SEC crew dangled in front of them with better power or utility than Mudd. Likewise, the Disco event history has been stellar, but both an end to those or a switch to bridge crew only are two red flags to consider. The two-bonus Courier mega with he and Morn doesn't seem terribly likely. Good overall stats and skill set make Mudd a fairly worthy behold choice, but a lukewarm reception is understandable.
