Bev has never been (and likely will never be) an event player - even Whizz kid Wes almost doubles mom's event tally. But despite her likeliest traits already being tapped for megas, she does own competent bases and theoretical bridge crew status, making her a probable thaw candidate some time in the future when you least expect it. Thin collection value may grow a bit if WRG moves forward with expanding other collections down the line.
