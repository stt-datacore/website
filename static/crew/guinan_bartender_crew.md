"My name is Guinan. I tend bar, and I gauntlet."

There are some ups and downs to get to where Guinan ultimately lands on the Gauntlet scale, which is near the top. She dominates her 1/2 skill pair better than any crew dominates theirs and has some of the most exclusive 45%+ crit sets in the game. When she hits on those, Guinan is a free win button that you can push through one, two, or even three fatigues. And if Locutus didn't exist, the conversation around her would be very interesting indeed.

Unfortunately, he *does* infringe on her DIP and DIP/SEC rolls, brings more overall power and flexibility to the table, and will often be a wall that you'll want to re-roll out of. If you luck into Guinan early on, she can absolutely carry your Fave Five, but on complete rosters is more of a rotational piece.

Guinan's voyage ability has taken a back seat - understandable after a few years in service. With only three anti-matter traits and an iffy power level, her usage for you will depend on the depth of your roster. Nevertheless, her ability in those areas plus an exclusive, valuable spot in the gauntlet collection comprise significant value for a single crew, even if you feel hamstrung by her fusion situation.
