Not nearly as bad as his episode, Mutated Paris contributes appreciable shuttle DIP and pairs it with double-digit event bonuses. He asks a relatively pricey build in return (chrons and Augment items), which means you may not want to level him until the week before one of his events. Or, indeed, you may not want to level him at all, given that his fused offering of Evolved Janeway far outstrips any niche role he can fulfill as shuttle crew - and thanks to the level 99 equipment exploit, Captain Janeway's far easier build is definitely the preferable option.
Captain Janeway/Mutated Paris - March 19
By their powers combined, these two form a pretty good crew. Mutated Paris already had some potential with his good Faction DIP, but now both have a unique new offering; immortal behold immunity. If you have the crew space to spare, target these two - perhaps even over some marginally better super rare crew. The payoff Evolved Janeway is much preferable to 1,000 honor.
