Big Show’s lone feature came during a mega event, of which none have been re-run to date. If you’re considering him in a behold because he has three skills, don’t. Any current event legendary at 1/5 or super rare at 4/4 offers hundreds more voyage points than Slaver does. His traits are depressing for event possibilities and voyage antimatter and he provides no peripheral perks.
