His event chances picked up big time at the 2018/2019 turn, but hard to say if it was a blip on the radar. His stats are generally too poor for daily use, but a slew of traits and usable-when-bonus SEC will highlight his name on occasion. A nice, though not essential pickup for the Veteran collection.
