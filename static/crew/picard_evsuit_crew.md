Reminiscent of a Mirror Spock or Survivalist Kirk, this Picard is a sum-of-his-parts crew who checks value boxes in an effort to overcome poor surface-level metrics. Viable in the realms of gauntlet, events, collections, and arena to varying degrees, you'll want to check how he stacks up against your current options rather than treating him like a first round draft pick whose power will force his way into service for you.

The easy comparison in gauntlet is a beefy Braxton. Better pri/sec pair and single CMD roll than the transcendent voyager means that Picard will outperform him there in almost every instance, despite not having any 45% or better crit sets. The resultant low bases combined with sufficient event chances might get him lost in the crowd of an endgame roster on occasion, but makes him more valuable than most one-off characters.
