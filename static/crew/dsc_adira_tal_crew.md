The Adira twins made a splash upon their inclusion to the game in more ways than one. Youngin’s can ask their grandparents about Adiragate, but alongside that noise was a pair of pretty attractive voyagers. They’re both doing alright in that regard, EDF less so, but have a bundle of unanswered questions otherwise.

A “Lasting Impressions”-style trait set (how would they have reacted to each other we wonder?) is a fun target for forward-thinking collectors, but it simply hasn’t bore much fruit for weekend event bonuses or collections so far. With Discover megas of yore hiding a shockingly thin event history, it’s voyages or bust for this variant.

Adira’s order of skills (and low anti-matter chances) is unfortunate for voyage efficacy, but will flip flop for event seating, when they inevitably grab a mega or two down the line. Until then it’s a waiting game as we hope for the Great Material Continuum to provide Adira’s traits with relevance.
