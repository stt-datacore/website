Bruce Willis.  Bruce Lee.  Bruce Dern.  Bruce Greenwood.  Bruce Kulick.  Bruce Wayne.  Bruce Bruce.  Bruce....Maddox?  Holy Disheveled Cyberneticist, Batman!

After 31 years from his initial Star Trek appearance, Bruce Maddox is back, baby!  Poised to stick around for a long time, this recurrin....wait hold on, getting an update here from my producer.  OK – Poised to be in 13 more minutes of Star Trek, this returning acto....wait, hold on, getting an update here from my ghost writer – OK – this replacement actor is going to give you all he’s got until he can’t breathe.  

Maddox shows the slow of the Power Creep™ that has graced the player base for the previous few months with an introductory rating of “Eh”.  Having 7 trait matches on Voyages certainly helps his ranking, but you won’t be staffing Event Shuttles or Gauntlet rotations with him.  His best value to players is three stat-boosting collections and catching a seat on a Voyage once or twice a week.  If you have needs in your Voyage roster for SCI ENG DIP scores, he may just be your man!

Maybe in the future, he will find more value with a Cyberneticist or Maverick collection.  Maybe, just maybe, if you say a Hail Mary, you can get a SCI/DIP Voyage with Maverick as a trait, which would be 100% of his top performance.  Perhaps still, you will have forgotten that he was released in the same month as Ultra-Premium Campaign Albert Macklin, who is superior in most comparisons.  Most every player will find a use for Bruce, but he’ll need to be Immortalized to do so.
