A fan favourite character sadly destined to be forgotten about. DB was playing it far too safe with this aspiring commander and as a result there is little to be redeemed from either her stats or her traits. Snap her back to being a first year cadet or suffer her smug grin taking up a potential useful slot in your roster. Shelby, youâ€™re in my way...
