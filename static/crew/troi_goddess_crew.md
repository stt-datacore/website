We always welcome eventable traits alongside main cast characters. The Hologram mega may have passed, but has also had a few standalone events. With a DIP that's second among both Trois and Holograms, she's a fairly effective event crew, though it's worth noting that if you made the (potentially dubious) decision to take Commander Troi's campaign, she'll perform at about the same level among variants as the Goddess, with a bit of SEC on top. The occasional 65% crit to pair with a MED roll just outside the top ten in the gauntlet gives her a bit of extra daily use.
