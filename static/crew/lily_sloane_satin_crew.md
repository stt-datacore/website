Miss Lily does have "variants" and an "event count", but with neither being impressive, you'll most often be leveraging her DIPlomacy for some part time daily shuttle work. A tertiary ENG has saved many a voyage crew and that's the case here where it meets an above average voyage score for favorable results. I won't oversell her gauntlet ability to you, but being one of a handful of crew who can 2-for-1 The Caretaker is worth at least something, especially to new players. She displays some of the hallmarks of aging poorly (DIP primary, no events) and won't find many situations where she really pops, but if you're a collection fiend, you could certainly do worse for a vanity crew.
