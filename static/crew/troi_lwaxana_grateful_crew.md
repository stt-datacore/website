Carrot Top is far less flashy than her dress sense implies. The event work is nil, the skill set is 💩 for voyages, and the traits have been thinner value than they look for weekend bonuses while having no proficiencies to latch onto in the gauntlet. 

Nevertheless, she has some theoretical voyage power if you've been avoiding CMD/DIP/SUCK like the plague and her skills align for great Faction seating opportunities if her traits ever do open up more event work.

She'll drop in value faster than other crew due to a lack of utility, but if you're a Majel fanatic (so say we all) and want a behold project off the beaten path with the promise of progress towards collections as a sweetener, you can be grateful to have this power creeped variant of one of the most joyful characters in Trek history.
