As Jimmy Demaret once said "Golf and sex are about the only things you can enjoy without being good at". You can tell by Doc’s art that Tee Time is in full agreement, having just spent a few hours on the back Nine.

A tremendous voyager, Doc combines his plus skill set with an absurd anti-matter hit rate, essentially guaranteeing him a trait match with every voyage. Strong overall power there and a splash of MED should see him rubbing shoulders with partially-fused legendary crew as your roster grows.

Even elderly players will have a use for this Doc variant. His worthwhile collection profile is an easy acquire on its own, while an oft-seated DIP base sees enough event bonuses each year to provide thawpertunities aplenty for this very spiffy dresser.
