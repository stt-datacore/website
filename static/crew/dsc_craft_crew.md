Once you get past the disappointment that as a human male, he won't be doing any weekend cadet work for you, you'll find he's a pretty solid card. His SEC base will bring a bit of power to shuttles if you are missing some of the bigger players, and his voyage totals are substantial with a nice ENG tertiary to increase flexibility and seating options. He's got a space in the Veteran collection and can also help clear some mission nodes with Veteran or Pilot locks.
