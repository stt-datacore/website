Hide your eyes, Trek fans. No Vaccine Yar may be thoroughly power creeped for Voyages and daily Shuttles, but there's still some meat on the bone here.

New players will appreciate Duelist's strong Gauntlet Trait set and big SEC roll providing great stepping stone value with her first star. Her CMD Proficiency may be miniscule, but a high number of elevated Crit Gauntlets (including several at 45%) is enough to get your fledging roster a foothold in the old boys' club.

Beyond that it's her Traits providing value in the areas of Collections and Events that you'll want to keep an eye on. Poor Bases may not make the thaw list for every Event opportunity or roster, but are at least an option when dipping into your requisition Shuttles. Yar also has a decent Collection ceiling of three, so keep long term value in mind as well.
