Well, here we are, the Destr - Spoiler herself. What can I say without spoiling things for those of you who have yet to see Picard? For one thing, I can tell you that you can get a month free of CBS All Access using the codes GIFT and ENJOY, so if you're looking for something to binge while we're all locked inside, hopefully I've just done you a solid.

For another, Soji is good. Damn good. We're about at the point where MED primaries are tipping over into common enough where I can't just give instant credit for them, especially what with her being the fourth MED primary mega character, but she's one of the best, so you'll have to endure my favouritism a little while longer. And for those of you who have somehow managed to avoid building up strong DIP bases, she'll help you out a little there, too.

Her traits outside of the invisible Picard show label aren't astounding, there's little to be found in the Gauntlet or the Arena for her, and there's no collection value to her, but her numbers are quite simply just that good. Absolutely worth citing up, which I'm sure is the question you came here looking for an answer to. See, I managed to make you read the whole note! That's how you keep engagement.
