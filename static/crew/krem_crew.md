“Star Trek Combslines: Profit Edition” is proud to present: Krem! Oh boy, if we here at the BigBook had 5 Dilithium for every time the game added an elite Ferengi Voyager played by Jeffrey Combs, we’d have 10 Dilithium. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s amazing that it’s happened twice.

And, an elite Voyager he is. A top option in his Triplet overall, especially in a few of his traits’ antimatter seats (somehow notably not Ferengi, thanks to the Skill+Trait distribution…), Krem joins us at a time when Voyage utility is seemingly handed out like fake treasure maps at a pirate convention. Throw in a beefy SEC Base and you’ll find plenty of daily use out of this Trojan Horse aficionado.

Unfortunately, that’s the extent of Krem’s current usefulness, relegating him to “Good, but not Great” status for the time being. This could change however, as while he’s only in 2 Collections right now (both Stat-Boosting), he has the potential for 4 more (*BB Writer’s Log: Supplemental* - 5 more, because we all know that the ‘Combs’ Collection is inevitable…). There will be no Gauntlet use to speak of here, but I’m sure Ulis could have told you that. As for Ship Battle utility, nothing in the current metas suggests any usefulness in 50% increased Boarding Damage, but we know that WRG plans to play around with Fleet Bosses as time goes on, so his ultimate fate is anyone’s guess.
