An underrated crew that happens to be usable in a few areas, though great in none. A huge proficiency total allows him to pitch in until 5* crew begin to trickle in. +1 Inspiring and Kirk's event count help make up for him being poor for daily use outside the gauntlet. Also tied to my favorite Trek music of all time.
