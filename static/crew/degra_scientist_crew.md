Generally, we look to acquire crew who offer something unique, but Degra, while unique, stretches the limit of actual usability. His bases, besides being power creeped, have zero room to maneuver between a lack of events to date and thin trait set. The Xindi trait could show up on the weekends (as could a hundred others), but unless that happens, those bases are empty calories and sit behind a gaggle of megas and perpetual event releases.

Degra is perhaps best known for his early activating arena damage, but it hits like a wet noodle unless paired with Locutus and actives solo on defense, making him a zero there. With more damage options entering the landscape like mega crew Garth, Degra is more of a curiosity these days. The most universal value offered by this card might just be his vanity collection spot.
