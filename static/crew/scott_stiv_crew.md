Poor voyage numbers, poor event count, poor Scotty. His highlight, an ENG base near 800, will almost never find bonus work and his aforementioned shortcomings undercut a useful skill set. The Doohan faithful may have to hope for a trait mega to rectify what DB stubbornly refuses to. His niche +EV/instant damage in arena is available, but accompanied by poor passive stats and a slow start time.
