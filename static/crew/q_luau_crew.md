Quau (or The Big Qahuna, if you prefer) is hardly the first incarnation of CMD/DIP/SEC among recurring mega crew, but with respect to T'Kuvma and Garth's arena hammers, he might just be the best. He improves incrementally on the slightly older giveaway crew Luau Paris and continues to reinforce the rule that CMD/DIP/SUCK should be avoided when possible, as that skill set will find it way back to your roster in droves from situations like this.

Despite his albatross skill set, Q's debut power and excellent non-HFS trait set buys him voyage run on any roster and should do so for much longer than similar megas of the past such as Suspiria or Thrax. Those traits also present players with collection value, both immediate and potential.

Despite DIP's overstuffed representation among crew, Quau's skills get plenty of seating on shuttles. He rates strongly against competition from all avenues for event work and shouldn't need to look far to find seats, which may not always be true for his fellow mega variants; the MED-led Q as "God" or proficiency-heavy Lothario Q.
