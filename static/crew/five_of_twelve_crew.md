On release, Five (AKA Axum) drew comparisons to Borg Queen for their CMD base and voyage similarities, but these days his scorecard is decidedly more sunset with hints of factory arson red. If he’s lucky, Five may be able to come close to replicating Queen’s collection or event mastery when his traits wake up, but it hasn’t been much of a horse race so far.

If you’re mulling Five in a behold, it’s merely for speculative value at this point as you can’t throw a dead cat without hitting a crew with “a couple of collections”. For a card who’s no longer a daily use option he does have a reasonable value outlook, but we’d like to see more of it materialize via traits before advising players to take the plunge outside of terrible beholds.
