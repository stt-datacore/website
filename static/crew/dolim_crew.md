Dolim’s value used to be lost in the pit of despair, but he’s since picked up a vanity collection and a mega’s worth of events. There’s some wiggle room on future weekend bonuses from traits, but that’s mostly theoretical value at this point. Even though his daily power is abysmal in most corners, a 2019 dabo update added two ships to the pool to help him activate his slow, but powerful arena damage.
