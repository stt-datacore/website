His reputation is that of a good ENG crew, but age is catching up to him. His three most likely event traits have already been tapped for megas, leaving all things Q as his best and possibly only avenue to weekend bonuses going forward. With voyage work trumped by almost every newly-released ENG crew, This Qrew is primarily a cryo-bound event piece with minor voyage potential on younger rosters and a stat-boosting collection.
