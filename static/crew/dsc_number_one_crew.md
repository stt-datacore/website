Three plus years is nothing to scoff at with regards to voyage work, but even though Majel2.0 is not dead in the water there, we have to scrutinize things a bit more for cards that offer little else.

The “little else” includes a top three DIP/ENG proficiency roll in a handful of gauntlets, but just like Discovery, Burnham is going to hog the screen time whenever that skill pair pops up and so Bex is limited to new player offering in that area. And, of course, the crossed fingers we have for Strange New Worlds and any boost to relevance for Ms. Romijn’s (like the lettuce) character.

If you’re mulling a Number One acquisition, it’s likely for her mid-range voyage ability which rests on the shoulders of adequate raw power and a 5-for-5 hit rate on voyage anti-matter traits. If she wouldn’t be a significant upgrade for you there, we might recommend shying away from starting fresh on a card which is painfully thin on traits and broader utility in general.
