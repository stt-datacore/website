Wesley's last note update was over a year ago, which tells you all you need to know about this crew. The numbers just aren't there anywhere outside of the arena and even though he's technically "a voyager" and "main cast", that does two scoops of nothing for his prospects on your roster. His yearly event already puts him ahead of a swarm of trash behold options, but with his weekend trait options on thin ice (prodigy?), he's a break glass in case of behold emergency crew. If you want to get an A, pass on Wes and don't feel bad when his once a year event rolls around.
