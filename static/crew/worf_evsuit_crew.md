SEC/ENG/MED is a combo with a very specific history, and, arguably, a very specific trajectory. The progenitor, Temporal Prisoner Chakotay, came out in 2017, and as the years have gone by and the power has sagged, along came Ba'ul, Prisoner Kim, and now, just over three years later, comes the first Son of Mogh to break his variants' CMD/DIP/SEC glut.

In many ways, EV Worf is a strict upgrade to Ba'ul, sporting equivalent voyage power, but not reliant on the hype train of Disco megas to stay relevant on the weekends (timely, considering said hype train appears to have been derailed) and possessing just enough traits that he'll find you a few more pieces of stray antimatter along the way. 

It's especially worth noting that WRG has established the precedent of re-running racial megas, and if the trend continues and we find ourselves in the middle of a Klingon mega come 2021, you'll find him holding fast as a top five Klingon option for all three of his skills. His general utility and regular event bump makes him a prime candidate for the Klingon collection, with and EV suit spot should it be expanded in the future.
