There are certainly some groups who think so and the opulence of the Convergence Day celebrations has prompted them to collect!","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using Birthday Cake Reed, any version of Kim, Stamets, Data, or Festive crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the U.S.S. Titan, the U.S.S. Cochrane, the Ferengi D'Kora Marauder, or ships with the Warship trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Warship (Ship trait), Birthday Cake Reed, Kim, Stamets, Data, or Festive","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_ve_callinginyourtab.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":26937,"symbol":"mccoy_dress_uniform_crew","name":"McCoy","full_name":"Dress Uniform McCoy","flavor":"McCoy must testify in Kirk's criminal negligence investigation, even if he does so defiantly.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_mccoy_dress_uniform_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_mccoy_dress_uniform_sm"},"rarity":5,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_mccoy_dress_uniform_full"},"skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":68,"range_min":44,"range_max":80},"security_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":33,"range_max":61},"medicine_skill":{"core":16,"range_min":17,"range_max":31}},"traits":["human","federation","starfleet","doctor","communicator","resourceful","tactician"],"action":{"bonus_amount":4,"name":"I Know Something About It","symbol":"mccoy_dress_uniform_action","cooldown":14,"initial_cooldown":10,"duration":6,"bonus_type":2,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":26937,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_mccoy_dress_uniform_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":2,"amount":25},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":26938,"symbol":"stamets_dress_uniform_crew","name":"Stamets","full_name":"Dress Uniform Stamets","flavor":"The dangerous journeys are over and the best ending to it all is sharing the happiness of your longtime colleague and friend at his wedding.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_stamets_dress_uniform_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_stamets_dress_uniform_sm"},"rarity":4,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_stamets_dress_uniform_full"},"skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":50,"range_min":28,"range_max":52},"science_skill":{"core":41,"range_min":21,"range_max":22},"command_skill":{"core":21,"range_min":11,"range_max":21}},"traits":["human","starfleet","federation","festive","romantic","resourceful","exomycologist"],"action":{"bonus_amount":5,"name":"Cheers!","symbol":"stamets_dress_uniform_action","cooldown":10,"initial_cooldown":6,"duration":8,"limit":3,"bonus_type":2,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":26938,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_stamets_dress_uniform_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":3,"amount":25},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":21455,"symbol":"data_dress_uniform_crew","name":"Data","full_name":"Dress Uniform Data","flavor":"In honor of Riker's and Deanna's “conjugation” Data took the stage and gave a performance that blew everybody away.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_data_dress_uniform_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_data_dress_uniform_sm"},"rarity":4,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_data_dress_uniform_full"},"skills":{"command_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":14,"range_max":52},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":41,"range_min":11,"range_max":22},"engineering_skill":{"core":21,"range_min":6,"range_max":12}},"traits":["federation","starfleet","android","musician","romantic","artist","festive"],"action":{"bonus_amount":4,"name":"Oh, Blue Skies, Smiling at Meeee","symbol":"data_dress_uniform_action","cooldown":10,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":12,"bonus_type":2,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":21455,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_data_dress_uniform_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":4,"amount":1250},"special":false},"quantity":1}],"threshold_rewards":[{"points":10,"rewards":[{"type":3,"id":2864,"symbol":"energy","name":"Chronitons","full_name":"Chronitons","flavor":"Chronitons allow your crew to take action in these chaotic times.
