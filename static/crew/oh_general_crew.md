An early 2022 mega littered with Romulans provided only a single piece of competition (Laris) for that hard-to-fill anti-matter seat on voyages, but it may have been enough to put Oh, otherwise lacking in power, out of work there permanently.

Generally fair-to-bad in most areas, it’s Oh’s arena work that’s of most interest. “Killy, but two seconds slower” is blasphemous for veteran players and may have them vomiting and rending their garments, but for players who don’t have perfectly manicured ship lineups or have bigger fish to fry with their crew retrievals, Oh does a fair enough approximation to last you a long time.

If you are that fresh faced Timelines cadet, keep an eye out for any of her 45% gauntlet sets. She doesn’t have the proficiency power to last past your first year in the game, but a reasonable CMD roll can handle mop-up duty on thinner rosters.
