Once the premier ENG/MED voyager and one of very few options available, we knew by his lack of other attributes that he wouldn't age the most gracefully. He may still make a few voyage runs in that specific skill combo, but the "meta" at this point is more to acquire power crew and let the collection tide raise all boats.

Rabbit's Costume Party collection has eased his descent to a small degree, but it doesn't get much worse than three traits for future event and collection potential. If your Rabbit situation is looking like a slow build over time through beholds, you may as well discount his voyage potential and treat him as a low-level collection option or bridge crew extraordinaire due to his comically large head.
