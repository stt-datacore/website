There are so few legendary MED/CMD crew that veteran players know them by heart. And in the same vein as Reverend Phlox, Pollard’s current value is very much tied to the simple lack of competition in her best areas.

Pollard’s raw voyage power is a big Oof these days and would be about two years out of service if she were wearing CMD/DIP/SEC colors. But although her usage in that area is narrow, there are a few skill combos for which she’s still guaranteed to ride. The ability to boost everybody’s weakest voyages is a siren’s call to many players and even though it’s rarely the best long term return on citation investment, Pollard is still an option.

In a post-Disco event world, Pollard is stranded on an island and trying to rub her two viable traits together to start a fire. Again, due to a lack of proper MED/CMD options and considering strong base metrics for her skill set, Pollard is more of a non-bonus option than it might first appear. Tapped out on collectable traits yet having grabbed at least a pair of collections, Doc Tracy is doing a highwire act to maintain value and a few well placed crew additions could send her tumbling.
