CMD/DIP/SEC voyage numbers scraping the bottom of the barrel means that Captain Sisko relies on his event work and collections for relevance. His CMD base is only second among Siskos (#1 Niners was given as a global gift), but close enough for our purposes and pairs nicely with both a healthy event count and double collections. There aren't too many situations where it would be prudent to spend honor on Ben, but two tough collections make him worthy of consideration, especially if you have a few stars on him already.
