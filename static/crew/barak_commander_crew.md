With super rare CMD options being added at a snail’s pace, Barak’s base rank has held steady for, frankly, far too long. But you can do better with your beholds than a limited shuttle pilot…we believe in you. If/when more of Barak’s traits hit on collection and events, he could become a crew worth revisiting.
