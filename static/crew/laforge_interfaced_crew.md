Whether you need a coaxial cable or a fiber optic, Electrician La Forge has something for everyone. La Forge's run as the premier DIP/ENG voyager lasted for nearly two years and even though several options have sprung up around him, it is a hugely pleasant surprise that there are so many different skill sets among the top options. Well done, DB. That's how you balance power creep and create several attractive options. For La Forge, that means that he retains citation-worthy status amidst additions to his wheelhouse and is a fine piece to the puzzle even if you have former mega Etana Jol or campaign Queen Po immortalized.

La Forge's event history is a bit murky, with a big chunk of his bonuses having come in Expedition and Skirmish endeavours. We'll still gladly snatch up his great base/event count pairing, but he may not have as many chances for a big bonus impact as other Faction heroes. Regardless, a strong, commonly utilized primary will help boost daily shuttles nicely. 

Geordi's proficiency numbers aren't necessarily eye catching and would be forgettable if he were CMD/SEC, but they come together to form a strong DIP/ENG gauntlet pair when his traits line up if you want to smack The Caretaker around, rather than bleed merits. There are certainly wrinkles to La Forge's value, but elite raw numbers will help him power through and benefit your roster.
