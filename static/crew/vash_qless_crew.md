Some wonderfully striking art could have you throwing citations at Vash in a moment of weakness, but that's not a recommendation for gameplay value. Her base and voyage ranks are on the wrong side of beholdable and even Scotty and Sulu are laughing at his variants' event count.

Ironically, the most solid path to value may lie in her handful of eclectic traits which are wholly speculative, but may have a collection or three by the time the ink dries on this note. Vash may be an interesting character, but this card is just not nearly as titillating as Q(uark)'s on-screen partner in crime.
