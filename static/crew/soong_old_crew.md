Noted turd pile Soong has been a punchline for years. That's it. That's his note.

Ok, ok...there's a case to be made for collecting traits and Soong does have three of four viable ones. Maybe hitting on a few more collections and megas would polish this crew, but by then you'll have even more 3-4-5 collection names who offer greater power or utility. You can probably count the number of worse legendary crew out there without having to take off your socks.
