“Jaysus Data, you’ve no idea what ‘good news’ is, do ye?”

Fear not, Miles, as your betrothed merely has cold feet, and will probably come around soon. Those of you not already fans of The Most Important Person in Starfleet History may need some help coming around on this variant, but we're here to help!

First off, Voyages. If you missed out on Federation President Archer, O’Brien here is a slightly less good version. If you did get Quantum Leap Archer, these two dapper gentlemen have very little trait overlap, so both can find home on any roster. Moving on to Shuttles, well once again O’Brien sits in Archer’s recent shadow, however he still has a top 10 DIP base at time of launch and takes the variant crown from Scapegoat (if you even have him yet), ensuring some Faction Event use when called upon. Those Events may come from one of the handful of traits that are long overdue for a Mega (Romantic February, anyone?), and bring with them 2 Stat-Boosting Collections and a fair shot at a couple more. His Ship Battle and Gauntlet utility leave much to be desired, but then we have to imagine that’s not why Keiko agreed to marry him in the first place.
