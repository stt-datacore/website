The phrase 'Dry as Vulcan' would be a little too on the nose here and not entirely true anyways. Solok's big CMD Base is worth thawing for his yearly handful of Events and with a collection Grand Slam on the board, there's locked-in long term value here. It remains to be seen if WRG ever says anything other than "Eh, just use Vulcan" for the Telepath Trait, but Solok should still be a fine mid-to-low end freezer-bound crew who can save you from much worse Behold options.
