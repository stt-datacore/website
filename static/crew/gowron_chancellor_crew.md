For a single star, not many crew can pack a punch like Ol' Crazy Eyes. There are very few scenarios where you'll be wanting him outside the gauntlet, which unfortunately puts his spot in the Diplomat collection out of reach for the average player. But inside the cage, he's quite the mauler. Owning the #2 DIP proficiency and DIP/SEC pair (3 overall) is formidable, no matter how well developed your starting five is. He's far better than his peers at 1/5, but additional stars are a risky investment.
