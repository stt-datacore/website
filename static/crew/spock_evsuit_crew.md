Weâ€™re going to let you in on a little secret that Big Sanitation doesnâ€™t want you to know - you can actually take the porta potty with you. Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s named after: portable potty. The more you know.

Thatâ€™s not to suggest that Spockâ€™s suit is full of ðŸ’©, in fact heâ€™s held up alright for a crew with a statistically under the radar release. Still a viable voyage piece, his fistful of anti-matter traits and very underrated skill set should give him a longer leash in that area than almost any crew of equivalent power. His traits (including the hidden â€˜evsuitâ€™) also give him big boy collection potential and will certainly make him a future retrieval option for any players who were absent for his introductory mega.

If youâ€™re looking for more long term value, check out his burly event history thatâ€™s as reliable as almost any crewâ€™s in the game. Quibbles over raw base rank or competition among variants donâ€™t carry as much weight when dealing with a crew who shows up with a bonus every other month - he should never hurt for opportunity.

With some new player proficiencies to help you crack into the competitive area of gauntlet, EV Spock hits the mark from a bunch of different angles and should have enough fuel in his jet pack to power up your roster for years to come.
