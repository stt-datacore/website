Somewhere out there in the future is a DIP/SCI Super Rare that will earn resounding applause, but today is not that day. If there are any Karen jokes to be made, itâ€™s probably because we want to return this one to the store, no questions asked.

Outside of moonshot voyage potential if a new roster gathers all four stars quickly, Karyn is merely a single collection piece whose inclusion in a future Desperate collection might herald the end of the game.
