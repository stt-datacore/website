The depiction of an emotional episode released on an emotional anniversary. Rest in peace, Aron.

One of The Commandments (7th? 8th?) is that thou shalt not make Ferengi crew too good. As honest, God-fearing folk, WRG obliges that order as often as possible. The collections are there and being released deep in the heart of the collection chapter means that for some crew, that's all they'll get for breakfast before being pushed out the door and told to sell, sell, sell. A pair of them for a super rare is fine and dandy, but his trait set is extremely unlikely to ever support more.

The drop off is steep from there - Nog's four digit SEC base ought to be good for something, right? Well, he only had a single non-Survivalist event in the three years prior to his release and as much as we hope for more from some of our favorite characters, it's very rare to see large swings in event work this late into Timelines. Nothing resembling a voyager, he's on the good side of a freeze-and-forget crew, but the thawpertunities will be inconsistent outside of mega events.
