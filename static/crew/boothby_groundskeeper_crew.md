A very rare combination of Skills means Mr. Boothby will be tending to your growing Voyages in no time. His stats on paper are not amazingly impressive but the combination of all three might just push your Voyages to the four hour mark. Sadly no eligibility for Cadet Missions knock him down a few tiers for gameplay use, but his strong Trait list has borne the fruit of 3 non-Rarity Collections for when you get around to finally finishing and freezing this flora fellow.
