Wesley's creepy friend has had a great run of almost two years and while he's certainly not dead in the water, several other options have begun crowding him out. After joining the game as the #1 base ENG, he now finds himself dwarfed by former Mega Ru'afo and is nearly equalled by recent Mega Etana Jol. That makes a non-event base a bit less valuable than it would be in a skill without that sort of ubiquitous competition.

I would still rate his daily work at least average and rosters weak in ENG may find it worth it to immortalize him for +1 Inspiring if fortunate beholds bring him close to FF.
