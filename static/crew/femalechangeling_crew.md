A launch card that stubbornly refuses to be completely pushed out of relevancy, Founder is at least usable in the realms of arena, gauntlet, and events. New players should see the most benefit as a Dominion/DIP node unlock as well as her gauntlet rolls are available from the first star. Although Balok's massive CMD/DIP roll represents the biggest threat to her usability yet, she can win a few rounds, particularly during Brutal trait gauntlets.

Founder has been usable for the occasional event thus far, especially considering the awful power level of most qualifying Dominion crew. She doesn't have the depth of event chances that other crew do, but it's at least a sliver of use to complement respectable arena evasion that can help protect you from most non-Krayton enemies.
