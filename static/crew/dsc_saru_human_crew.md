"Saru-Man, Saru-Man, does whatever a Saru can! Need advice? He's your pal! Like he did, for Su'Kal -- look out, here comes the Saru-Man!" Ahem. So, for those Doug Jones fans who wondered about the man behind the makeup, here he is! And what a solid addition he could make for your Timelines lineup. 

Time has taken quite a bit of shine from his debut monster score for Voyages, but Saru-man’s lasting impact shall be in his Traits and Collection inclusions.  He’s accumulated five checkmarks toward five tough and ever-expanding Collections, and his Traits may bear further future fruit with one more.

That suitably long Trait list also provides Antimatter bonuses and Event prospects beyond his Saru variant status. Shame he couldn't also snag Musician, because... "To him, life's a great big holodeck / Wherever there's a shipwreck / You'll find the Saru-Man!"
