Doctor, Doctor, gimme the news. I got a bad case of crappy stat blues. Geordi's murderer's row of Faction items in his build makes him a non-starter for daily use aspirations as his 2016 stats feel about as old as they are. The MED-led skill set is fool's gold on Voyages and you'd be better served just grabbing any modern Legendary at low fusion levels to outpace his contributions by hundreds of points.

But what keeps him afloat as a Behold choice is a thaw-able MED base which catches a bonus fairly regularly and triple Collections, plus viable Traits for up to two more in the future.  Note that despite owning three previous big bonus features, they were all in Expeditions (bring back Expeditions?!). He may indeed resurface in that role again, but almost certainly in a different event type.
