Shirtless art to pair with Scott Frontula's portrayal of Humbled Archer is worth a few tiers in somebody's book, but it won't gain him any clout around here. Probably.

The skill set assigned to the Enterprise’s Chief Engineer is an unfortunate one for voyages and a middling power level there has already disqualified him from competing against most legendary crew and superior super rares.

Instead his value comes from a shipboard attack boost best utilized by new players and a strong shuttle skill set. Trip’s somewhat meager trait list gives him above average collection value and has helped sustain an otherwise modest variant event clip.
