Coming in with hair that would make Master Shredder jealous and a catsuit that puts Seven of Nine on notice, Sarah Con-Yar is a crew that needed to stay Forever Young.

If you picked her up in her debut Tuesday Pack and Immortalized her, you had a superb Voyager who was about to catch a month's worth of bonuses. Things are rather more dire these days in both categories, but she has a mid-range value ceiling in the Collections tab if everything breaks right. As one-offs go, you could do a lot worse, but in the end, she will probably only break your heart.
