An all-in-one cadet package, Cadet Sito (she doesn’t accept the distortion of her name either) is the premier CMD option for weekday cadet work. Your CMD options are the one skill Ro or a few different CMD secondaries if you want to hit on eligibility five days a week, leaving Sito the best option by far when you’ve just started out and trainer and equipment are at a premium.

Her DIP secondary can squeak by a few nodes on Epic, while her string of traits offers myriad galaxy map node unlocks as well as yet unrealized collection value. This is a card whose value surpasses surface level metrics and is an excellent early game pickup to jumpstart your roster.
