🐐 O'Brien's inclusion as a vanity collection reward immediately introduces him as one of the more fascinating case studies of value and cost-effectiveness in the game. His statistical power does make the collection a worthwhile investment in general (and should for some time), it's just a matter of when you should prioritize doing so. With three prerequisite legendary crew you must immortalize before the machine spits out your candy treat, not to mention all of them sporting the same tired skill set, O'Brien's value should be tempered across the total numbers of stars needed to obtain and then fuse him. A set of calculations best left for spaces larger than this one.

As a standalone card, he debuts with fantastic voyage prowess which easily headlines his contributions. A plus skill set, despite the DIP primary, and score nestled snuggly in the elite ranks marry well with a half dozen anti-matter traits for which he's the top option. The rarefied air he debuts in doesn't just make him a juicy collection reward on day one, but gives the average Joe time to fill out their Badda-Bing collection and still receive a strong voyager years from now.

Not a one-hit wonder, Miles also parlays a big DIP base into not only the top DIP/SEC pair on shuttles, but a base for events that nearly doubles O'Brien's previous best DIP option; the fugly Klingon O'Brien. With his spot in the massive Costumed collection to continue the progress you made by citing the other Badda-Bing crew, Scape🐐 is a multi-angle contributor with debut power aplenty.
