The only number that pops is Dax's considerable event count. She receives a lot of praise from players, but I'm not seeing what they do. MED is useful in the early game and hers is tops among Dax crew, but in a small amount and her best gauntlet pair sits behind the stronger, more common Faith Garland and Doc Crusher. Modest shipboard damage will be replaced by faster options, but is usable for new players.
