"…barely a sex life and no imagination, but he knew phase coil inverters like no one else."

Did Jadzia say this about Tobin Dax, or did she know something about Chief O’Brien? Regardless, those two were joined via the process of Zhian’tara, resulting in a shy, friendly, absolute monster of a Voyager.

Part of the new wave of stellar Voyagers that WRG seems to be handing out weekly, O’Brien rates alongside fellow newbies Dr. Kovich, ‘Bullseye’ Kyle, and AGIMUS as the crème de la crème of their various Primary, Pairing, and Triplet combinations. That same Primary prowess, in ENG in this case, also lands him a safe spot on Team BigBase™, meaning that when his traits hit (and he has a few), he’ll be occupying those rare Faction Event ENG seats faster than you can bite your nails.

Mostly tapped out on collections at 3 Stat-Boosting ones (who doesn’t have 3 these days?), Tobin may see another added down the line but has otherwise largely maximised his return here. Lacking in other gameplay uses for now, what he does well is done very well, so strike while the iron is hot and seek out at least one copy (especially if you don’t have his aforementioned compatriots) to tide you over on those Voyages for years to come.
