His stat ranks remain quite good for a man of his age, but his use is sadly quite narrow. He's a zero in the gauntlet, arena, and events where he averages just one per year. Double 1100 bases may inspire envy, yet they're ranked low enough that someone playing a reasonable length of time is likely to have a crew ranked higher (Mega 5*) to handle non-bonus faction event work. Still, they're far from useless and he's in the mix among the better voyagers for a crowded SCI/ENG skill combo. If you're not a fan of [_DB's Wimpy ranked reward structure_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30knrJBeyr0) and care more about bases than event counts, he's a fine behold choice with a stat-boosting collection payoff at the end.
