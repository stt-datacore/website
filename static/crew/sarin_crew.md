Sarin, from the pilot episode of Enterprise, is one of the top three Suliban in the game. Are you wondering if there is more to this Shapeshifter? Yes, there is, but not much. She has a shiny new show Collections and four possible traits that could top her off at five when all is said and done. If Super Rares are still important to you at your stage of the game, she’s got a top 50 Voyage rating on release and a big CMD base. It’s been a long road getting a third Suliban in game, and this might be it. Enjoy it?
