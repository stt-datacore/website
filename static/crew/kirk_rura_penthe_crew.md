Kirk's Wrathful variant may have bumped RP down a notch, but don't ship him off to the dilithium mines just yet. The Kirk character tops the charts for variant events and between boasting an 80% Faction rate, two handfuls of traits, and RP's huge base SEC, you're looking at what is probably the safest event 2-skiller in the game. 

Even more well known is RP's arena hammer. Instant damage doesn't come any bigger than Kirk's 500% and a ship tailor-made for his cloak trigger, The Valdore, is now in the portal. If you don't trust Ferengi engineering and don't mind an extra button press, RP Kirk is a great arena and skirmish piece who will send your opponents to their frosty death in the wink of an eye.
