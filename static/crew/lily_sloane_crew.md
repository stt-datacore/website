Lily Sloane is absolutely a crew in this game. Little more than the sum of her Collections and Traits, as many Super Rares from 2016 are, Lily holds a trio of Collections and has room for perhaps one or two more, and she finally picked up a Mega Event in October 2023 with a surprise “Desperate” bonus. Bases are pretty anemic though, so don’t expect her to pitch in much even when her bonus number is called.
