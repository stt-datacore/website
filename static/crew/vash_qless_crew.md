Some of my favorite art in the game could have me throwing citations at Vash in a moment of weakness, but that's not a recommendation for the average player. Her base and voyage ranks are still on the right side of useable, but this is quickly becoming a very crowded skill set, so even as those numbers earn the troublesome Vash daily work on the majority of rosters, keen an eye on your SCI/DIP stack, and make sure you aren't neglecting other sets just because you're making goo goo eyes at Vash.

The longer term forecast is by far the trickier bit, but we can take a stab. With a variant event tally down in Scotty territory teamed with the previously mentioned commonality of her skills, Vash doesn't look to be an "age well" candidate. The aforementioned sturdy ranks and eclectic trait set make her a fine crew to behold or star up, but if you're playing the long game, look for a crew likely to be longer-lasting.

If you're a fan of Jean-Luc's sassy foil, this Vash will perform alright as Surak-lite for voyages and perhaps catch a few weeks of event work, but the card is just not nearly as titillating as Q(uark)'s on-screen partner in crime.
