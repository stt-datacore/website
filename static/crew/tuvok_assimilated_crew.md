CMD/SEC rarely needs help from players to burgeon on a roster and with a sinking voyage rank beside, that area of the game is not a big part of Tuvok's value any longer. Still of note are double collections and some steady event work punctuated by a few traits headlined by Borg. If fused early, his substantial attack boost on ships can be of benefit for the Arena and Skirmishes, even considering a slow activation time.
