Approximately no-one's prediction for the next Troi variant, this pale lass may be unexpected, but by no means unwelcome. With a #3 voyage total that outstrips her Mintakan sister by a whole two points, she provides a rarer skill set at the cost of particularly interesting traits - but who needs traits when you're Borg, baby? Especially the only Borg packing MED. With the new Faction still shiny and chrome and looking ripe for future exploration, Troi also nets two collections, +1 Borg and +1 Timelines' Originals, as well as an all expenses paid trip to Troi + Borg + Brutal events (15). Assimilation has never been so therapeutic.
