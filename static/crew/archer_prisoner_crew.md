A fairly lush trait set headlines this card, with one of them having hit on what is the largest stat-boosting collection currently in game. That same set of traits has hugely buoyed Archer's typically modest event tally and may offer further collection and/or event value down the line. Poor base and voyage metrics make Xindi Archer more a target for late game collection seekers.
