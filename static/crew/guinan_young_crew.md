We finally got young Guinan from TNG: "Rascals"!  YAY!

Oh wait, no.  This is Guinan from Star Trek: Picard.  Ito Aghayere's portrayal of the 21st Century version of Guinan races into Star Trek Timelines with dynamic art and zero sleeves, but carrying a box of toys for those brave enough to dive into a Tuesday pack.

In this box of toys are a big SEC base for non-bonus faction seating, and a SCI kicker to make her SEC/CMD top two skills not look as ordinary.  Do you need a power voyager for that Marksman seat?  Guinan is your gal!  You have to go all the way down to former Voyage powerhouse Wrathful Kirk, or CDS Uhura variant Rescue Team Uhura to find competition for that seat.  What else is in the box of toys?  She's the top choice for two more crowded antimatter seats: Civilian and Brutal.

Sadly, most of what she offers is her voyage power and seating priority.  Notably she has little to no Gauntlet usefulness, and Guinan events, like those featuring other recurring cast members, are nearly non-existent (at best).

Her arena ability, triggerless +10 Evasion at a quick 6s could find some arena use, and isn't helpful in the current FBB Season 1 Meta (The Doomsday Machine).  Only time will tell if Evasion will be useful in future FBB Seasons.

And since this is indeed a card collecting game, we have to talk collections.  Zero.  Well, as it stands.  Young Guinan has five viable traits that could hit to buoy her value into the next few years as her voyage power wanes.
