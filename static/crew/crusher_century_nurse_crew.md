Released a few months after Caldos Crusher, this Century version is a step down in almost every respect. It’s true that the usability of crew is not contained entirely within their relation to their variant siblings, but it sure does reek of lazy copy/paste from a studio that’s known for that.

True to form for a crew this old, Bev has aged out of Voyage use, and she’s left with nothing more than her Trait list to buoy her for weekend work in Events and possible Collection slots. An average to slightly below-average Collection ceiling doesn’t make her value pop in that arena, and Crusher variant Events are few and far between. While her debut Event has been rerun, look for bonuses more from her Traits than her character.
