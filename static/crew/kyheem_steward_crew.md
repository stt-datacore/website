If you've ever wanted Roman Captive Kirk without the outrageous swagger and stint as a 1980's beat cop, then welcome aboard Steward Kyheem. He's a one-dimensional card, but with excellent power in a straight line. 

Sitting in the right part of the Voyage power bell curve, Kyheem overcomes skill set and Trait deficiencies in the short term thanks to his raw power. Unfortunately, he lacks almost every other fringe attribute that makes up a valuable card. The one other area you might use him, early game Arena Attack boost, further highlights usage that peaks early and fades fast. A valuable piece to acquire early on if you can get all four copies, and perhaps with long-term value for a Super Rare if, and only if, WRG blesses us with Collections for three of his five Traits.
