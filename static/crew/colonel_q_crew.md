Few traits and a done to death skill set torpedo stat ranks which would be edge-case usable on certain other crew. The two (brief) stops on this tour come at the collections tab where he does *technically* qualify for two of them, but would be buried on the list of crew you'd rather fuse first. And some admittedly strong arena accuracy which comes online unusually quickly, but misses the big crit punch that other (super rare) crew can provide.
