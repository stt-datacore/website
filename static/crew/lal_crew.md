Lal's value is extremely polarized and therefore hard to rank in a vacuum. Her big base ENG is even ahead of 5/5s like Emo Chip Data, North Star Tucker and Seven of Nine. As long as she's occupying a shuttle seat in faction events, she has value. But once replaced there she offers almost nothing aside from a good-not-great +Attack in arena. If you're cruising along in the early or mid game, the odds are high that she can find meaningful work for you, but starting the climb from one star in beholds may not get you to max in time for her base to matter.
