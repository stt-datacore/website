This groundhog’s five o’clock shadow means six more weeks of Alamarain hopscotch. On the rare times Bashir’s Jem’Hadar jailors let him out of his cell, you can expect some reasonable help on voyages thanks to his worthwhile skill order and smattering of anti-matter traits. 

Once displaced from daily use, Captive sits just above average in the realms of collections and events. The latter of which has an acceptable number of viable event traits, at least enough to supplement Bashir’s main cast status, and thawable MED base. A fine starter MED crew, provided you can fuse him up in time for daily use.
