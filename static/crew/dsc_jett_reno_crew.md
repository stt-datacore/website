There might be a lot of 'ENG #X' for a hot minute here in the Big Book - Jett Reno made the sixth top ten ENG base in a very short span, and if you take a peek at the stat ranks to your right, you'll see that that pace hasn't slowed that much. If you've got former megas Ru'afo, Jol, and now Janeway in tow, you may not need Miss Reno for daily shuttles (though she can handle that task), but her other assets come together to make a card that can help your roster.

Whispers of the dreamy ENG/MED combo did not come to fruition for this particular variant, nor any realistic voyage work, but if you want this Disco Darlin', you can hang your hat on her event work in spurts (#1 Disco ENG), +1 to one of the toughest collections out there, and some great arena firepower (+10 attack/crit bonus) at a speedy four seconds.
