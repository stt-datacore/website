Faith (no ENT jokes, please) is a one hit wonder, but what a hit. Maybe the ultimate gauntlet stepping stone at the super rare level, her safety blanket MED roll features a huge minimum score and she has enough 25% crit sets to keep purchasing her entrance into your starting five even as your roster grows. With Bartender Guinan as the least ubiquitous gauntlet exclusive card, Faith's MED/DIP pair should have no trouble finding two-for-one opportunities or at least picking on weaker competition.

In most cases it's fine to stop at one star for this crew. Garland does have a trio of viable collection traits, but her bases are not suitable for event shuttles and her voyage ability is unlikely to help your roster in time if you're stacking one star at a time on her through beholds.
