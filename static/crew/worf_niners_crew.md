Not a standout by conventional metrics, Worf at least always has events to fall back on. Every variant has collected a few dozen bonuses to date and so despite a thin trait set which only has two items worthy of weekend consideration, you will find spots to use him a few times per year. Those reprieves from Cryo are also the excuse you need to finish him for his spot in two collections, one frivolous, one the massive stat-boosting Klingon kollection.
