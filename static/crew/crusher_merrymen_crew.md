First off, let's all take a moment to appreciate the best crew name this game has ever produced. Fetishists rejoice for a tier 1 name. Her bases are an interesting tale - she's the only appreciable Bev SEC with worthwhile MED as well. That hasn't mattered much for years, but a strong 2021 in concert with WRG's concerted effort to feature collection traits may give her more than the one (or no) event(s) per year she suffered through previously.

Speaking of collections, Bev is worth the dive for a lot of players. We can't possibly imagine her picking up another trait-based collection from Human, Federation, or Starfleet, but even if her collection of collections doesn't increase, she'll be good value there and enjoy a soft descent from atop the collection value rankings.
