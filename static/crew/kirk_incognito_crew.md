With the best bases of the 4* Kirks, you'd think there would be more to recommend this handsome chap, but with a vanilla skill set, a merely serviceable ship ability and traits that don't go very far, he seems appropriately inconspicuous. Almost as if that's what he wants you to think. Where this nondescript gentleman's strengths lie become more obvious when you take a look at his +1 Inspiring, and the fact that eleven of the _fourteen_ Kirk events have been Faction based. His CMD base suddenly looks indispensable when you're looking for ready, willing, and able shuttle pilots. Perhaps not crew for daily use, but handy for those who haven't cleared a [_tricky node_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Rabid_Fans), and definitely a keeper for the long haul.
