It was pretty damn cool to see Tuvok on a different series and in the mirror universe to boot. But with only a half dozen lines, does he warrant such awesome debut stats? It’s not like Riker’s cameo in Death Wish. Or Riker’s cameo in Defiant. Or Riker in… Hey, how come we don’t have a kickass Riker card?

Sorry for the detour, I was waiting for my Terran Empire faction store to refresh - it’s the only place where this Tuvok is available. And with a hefty 5,000 dilithium price tag, is he even worth it? Oh yea, he is.

On voyage merit alone, you’re looking at a top shelf investment. The number one Voyager by raw score has some pretty exclusive anti-matter traits like Vulcan and Scoundrel (the only crew in the game to have both) and he supports it with a fairly underrated skill set - one that isn’t oversaturated like CMD/DIP/WHATEVER.

Although he isn’t setting the bar for top base power too (come on, that would be asking too much), his ability there is plenty potent for both daily shuttles and event weekends. While WRG has been ignoring Tuvok events for ages, this variant’s traits have helped him sustain relevance over the years while also offering a reasonable collection ceiling to help justify your investment in him once his daily numbers begin to age.

Tuvok is a statistically sublime crew who doesn’t smother a bunch of other options like so many gauntlet exclusives have. Keep an eye out for him in your faction store and enjoy a character who’s ‘a man of integrity in both universes’. Probably.
