L’Rell of the House of T’Kuvma, First Of Her Name, Mother Of... Tenavik. A nice card showing the softer side of a formidable leader and a refreshing variant of Chancellor L’Rell's skill combination. We still have the question mark over whether Disco events will ever make another appearance, but regardless, she’s a powerful card in her own right. 

If you're looking to flesh out your Klingon collection, L'Rell's CMD/DIP/SEC skill set is an obligation, not necessarily a downside. She outpaces almost every other option in raw power with a sprinkle of eventability to boot. But if Klingon is not a consideration for you, L'Rell, while competent from a few angles, doesn't quite do enough to stand out in a crowd - matching dress and fingernails aside.
