He's an absolute unit. In awe of the proficiency of this lad. Like most gauntleteers, don't let the base and voyage ranks trouble you - he's a gauntlet master with the biggest MED proficiency of any crew in the game. The chink in his dice rolling armor is a minimum proficiency lower than some common super rares like Mirror Phlox and Nurse Garland - you'll be tilted more than once by low rolls that cost you a matchup you're "supposed to win". But considering the dearth of MED primary crew as the least represented skill in the game and his handy skill set shared by only a handful of crew, his reputation is well earned as a gauntlet force.
