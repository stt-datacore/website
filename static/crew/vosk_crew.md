Nazis. I hate these guys. What I don’t hate, however, is a CMD/ENG voyager with stats as purdy as this fellow. A top ten CMD base (which may not matter with traits like Na'kuhl), top ten voyage numbers, and a relatively unique skill set elevate Vosk beyond his one-off status. Perhaps not particularly eventable, but for daily use, you’re going to be hard pressed to find someone who offers quite what he does on voyages within even spitting distance of this potency.
