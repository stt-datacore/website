It's the amazing Science-Girl with her powers of Deduction! Yes #1 SCI base for 3* crew and can work on all weekend cadet missions. However her proficiency bonus is easily outclassed by other crew members but a strong base will easily serve new players well. Consider who else you have in your roster, Saavik for instance serves the same purpose but has a better overall Voyage score. T'Pol has the highest high for SCI but won't last long as other crew in your roster due to her disappointing average SCI score.
