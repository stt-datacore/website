The top ENG base for common crew sitting just above the much maligned Ensign Kim is merely boilerplate for a crew who's a one-stop collection shop. Enemy Lines Torres is the only common rarity Innovator, Klingon, and Jury Rigger, meaning she is an automatic immortalize until the end of the game.

But while it's tempting to do so early on thanks to her cadet eligibility monday through friday, she's also rated as one of the most difficult common crew to level. Keep her Maquis and KCA faction cost in mind if you have superior Uncommon or Rare ENG options.

An absolute diamond in the rarity rough who may need to wait a little while until new rosters can support the leveling (and replicator) cost, but worth the effort for players at any stage of the game.
