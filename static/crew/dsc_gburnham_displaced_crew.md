Despite the temptation, we can’t really steal Eddington’s “two skills, one airlock” tagline in this case since WRG gave Burnmom a respectable trait list. Aside from her very Joran Belar Sisko artwork, you’re looking at card value driven by trait-fueled collections and event work.

Even in the wake of Discovery megas, Gabbi’s event history has held solid. With usable base metrics, she should be able to pitch in on a few weekends each year, perhaps even partially fused. The rest of the intrigue lies in an above average collection profile which should have her popping up among other retrieval candidates on many rosters sooner or later.
