Even if 2020 hadn't boosted the ranks of MED/ENG, this Geordi would still find himself phased out of service. With voyage power too low to compete with any new crew these days, his skill set perk is one for shuttles as the only La Forge MED available. There are a couple of plus traits to supplement Geordi's clockwork event clip and double collections are always tempting, even if their impact is relatively small in this case. A murderer's row of faction items in his build make him an expensive investment - one that you might want to wait on until right before he can help you in a Faction event.
