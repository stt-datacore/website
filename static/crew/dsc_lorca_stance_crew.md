No longer the #1 CMD/DIP shuttler, Lorca has been outmatched by Tom Paris and Gul Dukat’s dopplegangers and what I can only describe as a green wench from one of Enterprise’s worst episodes - a more ignominious fate is hard to imagine for anyone who was playing the game when he was amongst the most desirable shuttle crew in the game.

He’s still the #1 Mirror and Explorer CMD, and will still hold down daily shuttles with aplomb if that’s your bag, but taking him in a raw Behold is a risky prospect without guarantee of a pay off if you expect anything out of him beyond a spot in his stat boosting collection. Buyer beware.
