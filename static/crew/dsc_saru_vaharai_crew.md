Legendary Sarus are fairly neapolitan, spanning the power levels from obscure to obscene. The Vahar’ai variant draws one of the shorter straws in this case. While still functional for events in a post-Disco mega landscape, DIP is a skill that Saru variants don’t lack. With show megas on the side of a milk carton and his traits less eventable than they seem at a glance, Vahar’ai will often be bullied by his older brothers’ obnoxiously large bases.

The news from the voyage front isn’t much better. His unboosted power level may limp through the end of 2022, but many endgame rosters have already stopped using him as there just aren’t many clutch trait seats or spartan skill combos for Vahar’ai to serve in.

As a former campaign crew, you’ll find enough players willing to share how their Saru performs, just be sure to shave a power level or two off of that assessment if you’re starting a first star investment from the ground up.
