MED cards are always on the top of everyone’s hitlist but the MED/SCI field has been somewhat filled out lately with additions such as previous-mega crew Q as “God” and the elusive Indulgent Seven. What separates McCoy from the pack is a healthy event count, a smattering of a rare spice called ENG skill and a pretty decent ship ability.

For MED work, McCoy will see plenty of work on shuttles and voyages, complementing Qod if you were playing during that era, and he may be your top MED/SCI crew should your roster be lacking. His ship ability has one of the most varied instant damages in the game with 400% inflicted if you can hold off of the trigger that long.

What I think lets McCoy down is not the decent stats in front of us, but the potential of what he could have been had his ENG and SCI skills been swapped. MED/SCI/ENG is a rare combination, but McCoy simply does not contribute enough engineering prowess to make a meaningful difference in this category. However, he has enough depth in numbers and sits in a few top tens so the choice to cite him shouldn’t be a hard one.
