I swear I remember this card being useful day to day. Maybe I’m the one infected with temporal parasites. I’ll tell you something else, too. I swear I remember this card being useful day to day. Maybe I’m the one infected with temporal parasites.

This T’pol is firmly in the cryo stage of her career, but thankfully she’s one of the few ENT characters who get any love from WRG, so her double digit variant events and handful of big bonus features in concert with a few well-placed trait megas should earn her chances to fly weekend shuttles from time to time. She may not be a priority behold choice until that theoretical point in time where she’s fully realized her maximum collection potential, but is a fine behold consolation prize instead of Captain Harriman or Maquis Eddington.
