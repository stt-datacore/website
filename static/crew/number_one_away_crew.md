Majel is a gauntlet crew through and through, meaning her first star is great, but spending extra behold capital a calculated investment. Strange New Worlds may open up a small avenue for variant events, but with poor bases beside, it's the rest of this card that's interesting. Armus-eque in the gauntlet, she owns two highly ranked pairs, one of which is only a few points from #1. On ships, she can reach +11 attack fast enough (6 sec) for almost any instant damage crew and her voyage work is average, even saddled with a bloated skill set. Not a weekend warrior by any means, but worthwhile daily numbers and packs a punch from star one.
