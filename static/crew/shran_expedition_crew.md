Sterling base and voyage ranks are much better suited for endgame rarity crew, where their contributions would last longer than a couple months. Still, you'll notice the difference between Shran and your average rare crew upon completion. Beyond those daily contributions, his blue skin qualifies him to work on Sundays to help you clear cadet missions with ease and he offers above average collection value.
