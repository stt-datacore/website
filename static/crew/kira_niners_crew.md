Niners Kira is a Marty McFly special - you may not be ready for her, but your kids are gonna love her. Falling out of daily use contention due to age, Kira chips in with a rock-steady event history and trio of collections ranging from the fluffy Play Ball to the biggest stat-booster in the game - Costume Party. She's an obligatory name for veteran players to acquire, though it's understandable if new players would like to skip collecting another CMD/DIP/SEC crew for the time being.
