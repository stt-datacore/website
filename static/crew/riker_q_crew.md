The William Riker legacy. Is it that he relinquished the incredible power of the Q for the sake of his friends? Is it the way he swings his legs over the backs of chairs and women? No, it’s this big, fat DIP base! By now you don’t need to be told that the skill set is redundant and he offers squat in several areas such as the arena and gauntlet where his proficiency total is behind over a hundred green and blue rarity crew.

But Riker is a household name with traits to spare - you can feel the heat coming off Victorian Pulaski’s cheeks from here as RiQer lines up even more of his traits for future event work. That classic Maverick/Gambler pairing that so many Rikers share helps boost his value via some likely future collections. If you're an endgame player who's only interested in super rares for collections and occasional requisition shuttle work, Riker may end up as one of the best to fill that role that the game has ever seen.
