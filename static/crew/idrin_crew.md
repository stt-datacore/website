Meh, one of the few Hirogen in the game who as a species specialises in roaming and hunting does neither very well. If you are looking for more SEC numbers (and I doubt you will be) then he might satisfy having the #6 3* SEC base stat, but his voyage numbers are frankly awful. Be prepared to run faction missions or open up the replicator to equip him too, but seeing as his collection bonus is limited to the Rare collection he's probably not worth the bother.
