Swords akimbo this illustrious holofanatic scores high among his peers with ENG skills. His triple of ENG/SEC/SCI make him an essential voyager too. If you are currently sporting a starship with a Position ability then his +10000 crit bonus will be very useful too. Sadly no cadet mission eligibility but his Innovator collection bonus makes him worth keeping around.
