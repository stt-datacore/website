Kirk's Wrathful variant may sit above this one in SEC score, but don't ship RP Kirk off to the dilithium mines just yet. The Kirk character tops the charts for variant Events and between boasting a healthy Faction rate, two handfuls of Traits (and associated Collection value), and RP's huge SEC Base, you're looking at what is probably the safest 2-Skill Legendary in the game.

A formerly well-known attribute that’s fallen by the wayside; his Ship Ability. Instant Damage doesn't come any bigger than Kirk's 500% and a Ship tailor-made for his Cloak Trigger, The Valdore, is available in the Time Portal. If you don't trust Ferengi engineering and don't mind an extra button press, RP Kirk is a great Arena and Skirmish piece who will send your opponents to their frosty death in the wink of an eye.
