Name dropping Martok and a fiver might get you a delicious chicken sandwich, but unbeknownst to most is that Martok has hit on at least one variant event bonus in five of six calendar years. With a half dozen other eventable traits, he a lesser known name who could end up driving your shuttles more often than you'd expect.

With now poor voyage power and a dire skill set, the only other point of interest is his set of collections. Filling so many spots at once while still offering occasional event work, Chancellor Martok is a fine name to behold or even toss a few stars on to earn some long term, if narrow, return on investment.
