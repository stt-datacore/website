At one point, Mayweather was viable for daily shuttles and voyages, but years of competition have stuffed him down into the roster-dependent pile. There's still enough voyage juice for newer players who can fuse him early, but the valuable Mirror collection spot and occasional Faction event help is what gives him broader appeal.
