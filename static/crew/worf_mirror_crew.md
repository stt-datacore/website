Outside of an occasional gauntlet fifth when he hits on his quartet of 45% trait sets, the Regent is unlikely to be of use for you day to day. Where he shines, however, are collections and the two scoops of events he's been bonus for with traits that support further regular weekend work. Taking stars for a legendary with such poor daily stats is often hard to justify, but his post-cryo value profiles as some of the best in the game, especially for a 2-skiller, which keeps him in behold and retrieval contention for veteran players.
