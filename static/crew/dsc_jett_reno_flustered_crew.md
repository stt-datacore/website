Whoa baby, triple collections and ENG/MED, Jett must be a home run! Well, kinda. Most first year players would get run out of Flustered on voyages, just beware that with the portal sized as it is, your roster may mature past what she offers by the time you snag all four copies. If she were to ever be offered as a featured event reward, choo choo!

Her trio of collections does make her an auto pick for veteran players, but she faces the spectre of never improving that count with Desperate as her fitting last gasp. She can be a pot of gold for certain players, but without a breadth of utility, a player who's not in the market for one of her two notable attributes may find her value somewhat diminished.
